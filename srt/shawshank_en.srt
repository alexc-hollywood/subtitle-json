1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,084
If I Didn't Care

2
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:26,342
If I didn't care

3
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:31,848
More than words can say

4
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:37,103
If I didn't care

5
00:00:38,314 --> 00:00:42,317
Would I feel this way?

6
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:47,531
If this isn't love

7
00:00:49,284 --> 00:00:53,162
Then why do I thrill?

8
00:00:54,581 --> 00:01:00,336
And what makes my head
go round and round

9
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,215
While my heart stands still?

10
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,928
If I didn't care

11
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:13,849
Would it be the same?

12
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:21,607
Would my every prayer begin and end

13
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:24,610
With just your name?

14
00:01:26,279 --> 00:01:29,490
And would I be sure

15
00:01:29,574 --> 00:01:35,454
That this is love beyond compare?

16
00:01:37,123 --> 00:01:39,166
Would all this be true

17
00:01:40,585 --> 00:01:45,674
If I didn't care for you?

18
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:05,694
Mr. Dufresne,

19
00:02:05,778 --> 00:02:10,031
describe the confrontation you had
with your wife the night she was murdered.

20
00:02:14,662 --> 00:02:16,788
It was very bitter.

21
00:02:16,872 --> 00:02:21,292
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around...

22
00:02:22,712 --> 00:02:26,256
And she said she wanted a divorce in Reno.

23
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,174
What was your response?

24
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:30,218
I told her I would not grant one.

25
00:02:30,302 --> 00:02:33,346
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

26
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:37,100
Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne,
according to your neighbors.

27
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:41,897
If they say so.
I really don't remember. I was upset.

28
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:46,527
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

29
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:48,529
She packed a bag.

30
00:02:49,614 --> 00:02:52,783
She packed a bag to go and stay with...
Mr. Quentin.

31
00:02:52,868 --> 00:02:55,161
Glenn Quentin.

32
00:02:55,245 --> 00:02:57,329
Golf pro at the Snowdon Hills Country Club.

33
00:02:57,414 --> 00:03:01,292
The man you discovered was your wife's lover.

34
00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:04,420
Did you follow her?

35
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:07,840
I went to a few bars first.

36
00:03:07,924 --> 00:03:10,801
Later, I drove to his house to confront them.

37
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:14,472
They weren't home, so I...parked in the turnout,

38
00:03:14,556 --> 00:03:16,140
and waited.

39
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:18,434
With what intention?

40
00:03:18,518 --> 00:03:20,311
I'm not sure.

41
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:22,605
I was confused.

42
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:24,356
Drunk.

43
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:29,111
I think...mostly, I wanted to scare them.

44
00:03:29,196 --> 00:03:32,448
When they arrived,
you went up to the house and murdered them.

45
00:03:32,532 --> 00:03:35,618
No. I was sobering up.

46
00:03:35,702 --> 00:03:38,454
I got back in the car,
and I drove home to sleep it off.

47
00:03:38,538 --> 00:03:42,000
Along the way, I stopped,
and I threw my gun into the Royal River.

48
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:44,294
I feel I've been very clear on this point.

49
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:48,173
Well, where I get hazy is where the cleaning
woman shows up the following morning

50
00:03:48,257 --> 00:03:53,929
and finds your wife in bed with her lover,
riddled with.38 caliber bullets.

51
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:59,226
Now, does that strike you as a fantastic
coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me?

52
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,144
Yes, it does.

53
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:07,317
Yet you still maintain that you threw your gun
into the river before the murders took place?

54
00:04:07,401 --> 00:04:11,196
- That's very convenient.
- It's the truth.

55
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,992
The police dragged that river
for three days, and nary a gun was found.

56
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:18,870
So, there could be no comparison made
between your gun

57
00:04:18,955 --> 00:04:23,125
and the bullets taken from
the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

58
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:27,295
And that also...

59
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,381
is very convenient.

60
00:04:29,465 --> 00:04:30,966
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

61
00:04:32,176 --> 00:04:34,427
Since I am innocent of this crime, sir,

62
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:38,099
I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

63
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:41,352
If I Didn't Care

64
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:48,526
And would I be sure that this

65
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,239
Is love beyond compare...

66
00:04:56,785 --> 00:04:59,704
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've heard all the evidence.

67
00:04:59,788 --> 00:05:02,373
We have the accused at the scene of the crime.

68
00:05:02,457 --> 00:05:04,292
We have footprints, tire tracks,

69
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:08,421
bullets strewn on the ground which bear
his fingerprints, a broken bourbon bottle,

70
00:05:08,505 --> 00:05:10,631
likewise with fingerprints.

71
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:12,383
And most of all,

72
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:14,760
we have a beautiful young woman and her lover

73
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:16,929
lying dead in each other's arms.

74
00:05:19,016 --> 00:05:21,267
They had sinned.

75
00:05:22,895 --> 00:05:26,898
But was their crime so great
as to merit a death sentence?

76
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:30,151
Now, while you think about that...

77
00:05:31,862 --> 00:05:34,363
..think about this.

78
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:36,992
A revolver holds six bullets.

79
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:38,452
Not eight.

80
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:41,997
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded
crime of passion.

81
00:05:42,081 --> 00:05:45,125
That could be understood, if not condoned.

82
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,836
No. This was revenge...

83
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:52,424
of a much more brutal
and cold-blooded nature. Consider this.

84
00:05:52,508 --> 00:05:55,052
Four bullets per victim.

85
00:05:55,136 --> 00:05:57,512
Not six shots fired, but eight.

86
00:05:57,597 --> 00:06:01,516
That means that he fired the gun empty,

87
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:03,894
and then stopped to reload...

88
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,564
..so that he could shoot each of them again.

89
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:10,234
An extra bullet per lover.

90
00:06:10,318 --> 00:06:12,361
Right in the head.

91
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:21,328
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

92
00:06:21,412 --> 00:06:23,664
It chills my blood just to look at you.

93
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,377
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine,

94
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:32,005
I hereby order you to serve two life sentences,
back to back.

95
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:35,718
One for each of your victims. So be it.

96
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:02,412
Sit.

97
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,377
We see by your file
you've served 20 years of a life sentence.

98
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:11,045
Yes, sir.

99
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,589
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

100
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:15,883
Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

101
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:19,470
I mean, I learned my lesson.

102
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:23,808
I can honestly say...I'm a changed man.

103
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:29,856
I'm no longer a danger to society.

104
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,026
That's God's honest truth.

105
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,981
Hey, Red. How'd it go?

106
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:13,692
Same old shit. Different day.

107
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:17,404
Yeah. I know how you feel.
I'm up for rejection next week.

108
00:08:18,573 --> 00:08:21,158
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

109
00:08:21,242 --> 00:08:22,534
It happens.

110
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:24,203
Hey, Red. Bump me a deck.

111
00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:27,664
Get the fuck out of my face, will you, man?
You've had five packs already.

112
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:28,957
- Four.
- Five.

113
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:33,546
There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

114
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:35,548
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

115
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:38,760
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer - if that's your thing -

116
00:08:38,844 --> 00:08:42,430
a bottle of brandy
to celebrate your kid's high-school graduation.

117
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:44,849
Damn near anything, within reason.

118
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:47,227
Yes, sir. I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

119
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:54,943
So, when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949

120
00:08:55,027 --> 00:08:58,363
and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth
into the prison for him,

121
00:08:58,447 --> 00:09:00,532
I told him, "No problem."

122
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:44,910
Andy came to Shawshank Prison

123
00:09:44,995 --> 00:09:49,123
in early 1947, for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

124
00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:53,502
On the outside he had been vice-president
of a large Portland bank.

125
00:09:53,587 --> 00:09:55,588
Good work for a man as young as he was.

126
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:02,636
Hey, Red.

127
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,344
Do you speak English, butt steak?
You follow this officer.

128
00:10:55,316 --> 00:10:59,694
I haven't seen such a sorry-looking heap
of m-m-maggot shit in all my life.

129
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:01,863
Hey, fish! Come over here.

130
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:19,798
Come on, fish.

131
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:27,181
Taking bets today, Red?

132
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:29,267
Smokes or coins? Better's choice.

133
00:11:29,351 --> 00:11:31,143
Smokes. Put me down for two.

134
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:33,271
All right. Who's your horse?

135
00:11:33,355 --> 00:11:36,649
That little sack of shit...eighth from the front.

136
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:37,900
He'll be first.

137
00:11:37,985 --> 00:11:40,194
- Bullshit. I'll take that action.
- Me too.

138
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,530
You're out some smokes, son. Let me tell you.

139
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:44,532
Heywood, you're so smart, you call it.

140
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:47,118
I'll take...t-t-the chubby fat-ass there.

141
00:11:47,202 --> 00:11:50,580
The fifth one from the front.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

142
00:11:50,664 --> 00:11:53,541
Fresh fish!

143
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,712
Fresh fish today! We're reeling them in!

144
00:11:57,796 --> 00:12:02,049
I must admit, I didn't think much of Andy,
first time I laid eyes on him.

145
00:12:02,134 --> 00:12:05,636
Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.

146
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:08,014
That was my first impression of the man.

147
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:09,807
What do you say, Red?

148
00:12:09,891 --> 00:12:13,144
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

149
00:12:13,228 --> 00:12:15,396
That guy? Never happen.

150
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,606
Ten cigarettes.

151
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,857
That's a rich bet.

152
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:20,151
All right. Who's gonna prove me wrong?

153
00:12:20,235 --> 00:12:22,321
Heywood? Jigger?

154
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:23,864
Skeet?

155
00:12:23,948 --> 00:12:26,158
Floyd?

156
00:12:26,242 --> 00:12:28,368
Four brave souls.

157
00:12:28,453 --> 00:12:31,288
Return to your cell blocks for evening count.

158
00:12:31,372 --> 00:12:33,874
All prisoners return to your cell blocks.

159
00:12:54,979 --> 00:12:57,064
Turn to the right. Eyes front.

160
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:13,497
This is Mr. Hadley. He's Captain of the Guards.

161
00:13:13,581 --> 00:13:15,749
I'm Mr. Norton, the Warden.

162
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,335
You are convicted felons.

163
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:20,755
That's why they've sent you to me.

164
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,465
Rule number one:

165
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:24,425
No blasphemy.

166
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,054
I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain
in my prison.

167
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:29,514
The other rules...

168
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:31,307
you'll figure out as you go along.

169
00:13:31,392 --> 00:13:33,184
Any questions?

170
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:34,477
When do we eat?

171
00:13:42,986 --> 00:13:45,154
You eat when we say you eat!

172
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:48,616
You shit when we say you shit,
and you piss when we say you piss.

173
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:51,577
You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?

174
00:13:51,662 --> 00:13:52,954
Aarghh!

175
00:13:53,038 --> 00:13:54,997
On your feet.

176
00:13:55,082 --> 00:13:56,874
I believe in two things.

177
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,836
Discipline and the Bible.

178
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,754
Here you'll receive both.

179
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:05,508
Put your trust in the Lord.

180
00:14:05,592 --> 00:14:07,468
Your ass belongs to me.

181
00:14:09,555 --> 00:14:11,639
Welcome to Shawshank.

182
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,188
Unhook 'em.

183
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,320
Turn around.

184
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,079
That's enough.

185
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,915
Move to the end of the cage.

186
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,375
Turn around.

187
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,710
Delouse him.

188
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,796
Turn around.

189
00:14:45,383 --> 00:14:48,552
Move out of the cage, go left.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

190
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:50,179
Next man up.

191
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:55,476
To the right. Right, right, right.

192
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,102
Left, left...

193
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:01,356
The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

194
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:04,568
They march you in,
naked as the day you were born,

195
00:15:04,652 --> 00:15:08,739
skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit they throw on you.

196
00:15:08,823 --> 00:15:11,784
And when they put you in that cell,

197
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:14,536
and those bars slam home...

198
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:17,373
that's when you know it's for real.

199
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,794
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.

200
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,086
Nothing left,

201
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,881
but all the time in the world to think about it.

202
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,886
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

203
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,264
Somebody always breaks down crying.

204
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,809
Happens every time.

205
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,977
The only question is:

206
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,479
Who's it gonna be?

207
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,149
It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.

208
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,153
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

209
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,414
Lights out!

210
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:22,022
I remember my first night.

211
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,191
Seems like a long time ago.

212
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,195
Yoo-hoo!

213
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,781
Hey, fish.

214
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:33,909
Fish, fish, fish, fish, fishy.

215
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:37,913
- Boy, are you scared of the dark?
- You like it here, new fish?

216
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,332
You'll wish
your daddy never dicked your mommy.

217
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:44,420
Fishy! Oh, I want me a pork chop. Oh, yes!

218
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:49,550
You taking this down, new fish?
There's gonna be a quiz later!

219
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:53,012
- Poke your ass out, give me a first look!
- Shh! Keep it down.

220
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:56,432
The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

221
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,559
They don't quit till they reel someone in.

222
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,731
Hey, Fat Ass.

223
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,482
Fat Ass.

224
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,153
Talk to me, boy.

225
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,947
I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.

226
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,951
Don't you listen to these nitwits.
You hear me?

227
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:17,120
This place ain't so bad.

228
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,830
I tell you what.

229
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:23,168
I'll introduce you around.
Make you feel right at home.

230
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:25,837
I know a couple of big old bull queers

231
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:28,882
that would just love to make your acquaintance.

232
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:32,385
Especially that big, white,
m- mushy butt of yours.

233
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,387
God!

234
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:35,972
I don't belong here!

235
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:37,474
We have a winner!

236
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,309
I wanna go home!

237
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,227
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

238
00:17:41,312 --> 00:17:44,481
Hey, it's the fat guy! It's the fat guy!

239
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:48,401
Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

240
00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:51,196
I don't belong here!

241
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,489
Fresh fish!

242
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:55,909
I wanna go home. I want my mommy.

243
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,995
I had your mother. She wasn't that great.

244
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,580
Fresh fish!

245
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,210
What the Christ is this happy horse shit?

246
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:08,004
He took the Lord's name in vain.
I'm telling the Warden.

247
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:09,589
With my baton up your ass!

248
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:11,342
Let me out of here!

249
00:18:11,426 --> 00:18:14,804
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

250
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:16,055
Please...

251
00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:18,182
I ain't supposed to be here.

252
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:19,642
Not me!

253
00:18:19,726 --> 00:18:22,186
I ain't gonna count to three, or even one.

254
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,563
Shut the fuck up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!

255
00:18:24,648 --> 00:18:26,482
Shut up, man. Shut up.

256
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:27,858
There's been a mistake!

257
00:18:27,943 --> 00:18:31,112
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here!

258
00:18:31,196 --> 00:18:32,279
Open that cell.

259
00:18:32,364 --> 00:18:36,534
Me neither.
You people run this place like a fucking prison!

260
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:46,043
Son of a bitch.

261
00:18:50,215 --> 00:18:52,299
Take it easy.

262
00:19:15,074 --> 00:19:18,452
If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here
the rest of the night,

263
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:22,205
I swear by God and sonny Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

264
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,374
Every last motherfucker in here.

265
00:19:28,296 --> 00:19:31,965
Call the trustees.
Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.

266
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:50,984
His first night in the joint,
Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.

267
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:53,945
He never made a sound.

268
00:20:09,463 --> 00:20:12,715
Tier 3 North. Clear.

269
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,967
Tier 2 South. Clear.

270
00:20:15,052 --> 00:20:16,928
Tier 3 South. Clear.

271
00:20:17,012 --> 00:20:18,971
Tier 1 North...

272
00:20:19,056 --> 00:20:21,849
- Tier 1 South. Clear.
- Tier 4 South. Clear.

273
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:24,018
Prepare to roll out.

274
00:20:27,397 --> 00:20:29,482
Roll out!

275
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:25,164
Are... Are you going to eat that?

276
00:21:25,248 --> 00:21:28,167
I hadn't... I hadn't planned on it.

277
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:30,460
Do you mind?

278
00:21:37,802 --> 00:21:40,429
Ah...that's nice and ripe.

279
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:54,484
Jake says thank you.

280
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:56,987
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.

281
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,786
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

282
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:05,663
Oh, no, no. Here he comes.

283
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:12,712
Morning, fellas. Fine morning, ain't it?

284
00:22:12,796 --> 00:22:15,215
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?

285
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:17,717
Come on. Set 'em down.
I want 'em all lined up here,

286
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:20,595
just like a pretty little chorus line.

287
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:22,764
Yeah, look at that!

288
00:22:22,848 --> 00:22:25,725
- Look at that. Oh, Lord!
- I can't stand this guy.

289
00:22:26,936 --> 00:22:29,604
Yes. Richmond, Virginia.

290
00:22:29,688 --> 00:22:31,773
- Smell my ass!
- After he smells mine.

291
00:22:31,857 --> 00:22:37,195
Gee, Red, it was a terrible shame
about your horse coming in last, an' all.

292
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,490
But I sure do love that winning horse of mine,
though.

293
00:22:40,574 --> 00:22:43,284
I owe that boy a great big, sloppy kiss
when I see him.

294
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:46,371
Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes,
instead?

295
00:22:46,455 --> 00:22:48,248
Lucky fuck.

296
00:22:48,332 --> 00:22:50,041
Hey, Tyrell.

297
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:53,086
You pull infirmary duty this week?

298
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,879
How's that horse of mine doing?

299
00:22:54,964 --> 00:22:56,422
Dead.

300
00:22:56,507 --> 00:23:01,887
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.
The doc had already gone home for the night.

301
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,640
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

302
00:23:04,724 --> 00:23:07,559
By then, hell, there weren't nothing we could do.

303
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:14,942
What was his name?

304
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:19,571
What did you say?

305
00:23:21,449 --> 00:23:23,826
I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.

306
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,620
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

307
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:31,458
It doesn't fuckin' matter what his name was.
He's dead.

308
00:23:50,812 --> 00:23:53,147
Hey...

309
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:55,983
Anybody come at you yet?

310
00:23:57,485 --> 00:23:59,487
Anybody get to you yet?

311
00:24:00,614 --> 00:24:03,658
Hey, we all need friends in here.

312
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:05,660
I could be a friend to you.

313
00:24:08,122 --> 00:24:09,789
Hey...

314
00:24:14,628 --> 00:24:16,504
Hard to get.

315
00:24:18,174 --> 00:24:19,841
I like that.

316
00:24:26,474 --> 00:24:29,768
Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.

317
00:24:29,852 --> 00:24:32,312
I guess he had a lot on his mind,

318
00:24:32,396 --> 00:24:34,606
trying to adapt to life on the inside.

319
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,860
It wasn't until a month went by
that he opened his mouth

320
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,237
to say more than two words to somebody.

321
00:24:43,157 --> 00:24:45,200
As it turned out...

322
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:47,202
that somebody was me.

323
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,959
Officers Russell and Burwell
report to the duty officer.

324
00:24:56,003 --> 00:24:58,756
I'm Andy Dufresne.

325
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,925
The wife-killing banker.

326
00:25:02,761 --> 00:25:04,470
Why did you do it?

327
00:25:04,554 --> 00:25:06,180
I didn't, since you ask.

328
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:09,308
You're gonna fit right in!

329
00:25:09,393 --> 00:25:12,561
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

330
00:25:12,646 --> 00:25:15,981
- Heywood, what are you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

331
00:25:18,902 --> 00:25:21,695
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

332
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,533
You think your shit smells sweeter than most.
Is that right?

333
00:25:25,617 --> 00:25:27,952
- What do you think?
- To tell you the truth,

334
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:31,122
I haven't made up my mind.

335
00:25:31,206 --> 00:25:35,292
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

336
00:25:35,377 --> 00:25:38,879
I'm known to locate certain things,
from time to time.

337
00:25:38,964 --> 00:25:41,966
- I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.
- A what?

338
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,426
A rock hammer.

339
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,803
- What is it, and why?
- What do you care?

340
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:50,558
Well, if it was a toothbrush, I'd just quote a price,

341
00:25:50,642 --> 00:25:53,227
but then a toothbrush is a non-lethal object.

342
00:25:54,646 --> 00:25:56,356
Fair enough.

343
00:25:56,441 --> 00:25:58,900
A rock hammer
is about six or seven inches long.

344
00:25:58,985 --> 00:26:00,610
Looks like a miniature pickaxe.

345
00:26:00,695 --> 00:26:01,820
Pickaxe?

346
00:26:01,904 --> 00:26:03,989
- For rocks.
- Rocks.

347
00:26:05,658 --> 00:26:07,826
Quartz?

348
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,578
Quartz.

349
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,206
And some mica.

350
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:14,458
Shale.

351
00:26:15,543 --> 00:26:17,127
Limestone.

352
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:19,129
So?

353
00:26:19,213 --> 00:26:21,298
So, I'm a rock hound.

354
00:26:21,382 --> 00:26:24,593
At least, I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again on a limited basis.

355
00:26:24,677 --> 00:26:26,803
Or maybe you want
to hammer somebody's skull.

356
00:26:26,888 --> 00:26:28,346
No, sir.

357
00:26:29,474 --> 00:26:31,057
I have no enemies here.

358
00:26:31,142 --> 00:26:33,518
No? Wait a while.

359
00:26:35,062 --> 00:26:37,230
Word gets around.

360
00:26:37,315 --> 00:26:40,442
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

361
00:26:40,526 --> 00:26:42,319
Especially Bogs.

362
00:26:43,404 --> 00:26:47,616
I don't suppose it would help any
if I explained to them I'm not homosexual.

363
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,201
Neither are they.

364
00:26:49,285 --> 00:26:51,995
You have to be human first. They don't qualify.

365
00:26:57,252 --> 00:27:01,797
Bull queers take by force.
It's all they want or understand.

366
00:27:01,882 --> 00:27:05,510
If I were you,
I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.

367
00:27:05,594 --> 00:27:06,928
Thanks for the advice.

368
00:27:07,012 --> 00:27:08,596
Well, that's free.

369
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,932
You understand my concern.

370
00:27:11,016 --> 00:27:13,559
Well, if there's any trouble,
I won't use the hammer.

371
00:27:13,644 --> 00:27:17,855
Then I guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

372
00:27:19,316 --> 00:27:21,108
Did I miss something? What's funny?

373
00:27:21,193 --> 00:27:24,237
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

374
00:27:26,114 --> 00:27:28,115
What's an item like this usually go for?

375
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,244
Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

376
00:27:31,328 --> 00:27:34,038
My normal mark-up's 20 per cent.

377
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:36,582
But this is a specialty item.

378
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:39,252
The risk goes up, the price goes up.

379
00:27:39,253 --> 00:27:41,212
Let's make it an even ten bucks.

380
00:27:41,296 --> 00:27:43,172
Ten it is.

381
00:27:44,258 --> 00:27:46,676
Waste of money, if you ask me.

382
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,302
Why's that?

383
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:52,432
Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.

384
00:27:54,018 --> 00:27:56,311
If they find it, you're gonna lose it.

385
00:27:56,396 --> 00:27:58,522
If they do catch you with it, you don't know me.

386
00:27:58,606 --> 00:28:00,816
Mention my name, we never do business again.

387
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,027
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now, you got that?

388
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,947
I understand.

389
00:28:07,031 --> 00:28:08,448
Thank you...

390
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:10,075
Mr. er...?

391
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,619
Red. The name's Red.

392
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,662
Red?

393
00:28:13,746 --> 00:28:16,498
Why do they call you that?

394
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:22,254
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

395
00:28:30,221 --> 00:28:33,265
I could see
why some of the boys took him for snobby.

396
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:36,768
He had a quiet way about him.

397
00:28:36,853 --> 00:28:41,315
A walk and a talk
that just wasn't normal around here.

398
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:42,941
He strolled...

399
00:28:43,026 --> 00:28:47,362
like a man in a park,
without a care or worry in the world.

400
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:52,160
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

401
00:28:52,244 --> 00:28:56,414
Yeah. I think it would be fair to say...

402
00:28:56,415 --> 00:28:58,499
I liked Andy from the start.

403
00:29:00,252 --> 00:29:03,463
Let's go!
Some of us have got a schedule to keep.

404
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:08,843
Move it! Come on. Move it!

405
00:29:12,473 --> 00:29:15,600
Bob, how are you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

406
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,778
Easy.

407
00:29:26,862 --> 00:29:28,946
Keep it moving.

408
00:29:31,742 --> 00:29:32,992
Red...

409
00:29:53,515 --> 00:29:57,726
Andy was right. I finally got the joke.

410
00:29:57,811 --> 00:30:02,314
It would take a man about 600 years
to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

411
00:30:06,653 --> 00:30:07,778
Book?

412
00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:09,738
Not today.

413
00:30:15,078 --> 00:30:17,162
- Book?
- No.

414
00:30:18,957 --> 00:30:20,165
Hey, Brooksy.

415
00:30:23,461 --> 00:30:25,546
Delivery for Dufresne.

416
00:30:32,637 --> 00:30:38,267
Book?

417
00:30:41,271 --> 00:30:43,397
Dufresne...

418
00:30:43,481 --> 00:30:45,650
Here's your book.

419
00:30:50,072 --> 00:30:51,740
Thanks.

420
00:30:55,578 --> 00:30:58,788
Dufresne! We're running low on Hexlite.

421
00:30:58,873 --> 00:31:00,957
Get on back and fetch us up some.

422
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,121
If you get this in your eyes, it blinds you.

423
00:31:40,206 --> 00:31:42,957
Honey...hush.

424
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:57,431
That's it. You fight.

425
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:59,099
It's better that way.

426
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:10,361
I wish I could tell you
that Andy fought the good fight,

427
00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:12,988
and the Sisters let him be.

428
00:32:13,073 --> 00:32:15,074
I wish I could tell you that.

429
00:32:15,158 --> 00:32:17,243
But prison is no fairy-tale world.

430
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:21,330
He never said who did it.

431
00:32:21,414 --> 00:32:24,458
But we all knew.

432
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:30,673
Things went on like that for a while.

433
00:32:30,757 --> 00:32:33,384
Prison life consists of routine...

434
00:32:33,468 --> 00:32:35,678
and then more routine.

435
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:41,893
Every so often,
Andy would show up with fresh bruises.

436
00:32:43,062 --> 00:32:45,105
The Sisters kept at him.

437
00:32:45,189 --> 00:32:49,317
Sometimes he was able to fight 'em off.
Sometimes not.

438
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:52,654
And that's how it went for Andy.

439
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:55,282
That was his routine.

440
00:32:55,366 --> 00:32:59,160
I do believe
those first two years were the worst for him.

441
00:32:59,245 --> 00:33:01,496
And I also believe,

442
00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:06,126
if things had gone on that way,
this place would have got the best of him.

443
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,170
But then, in the spring of 1949,

444
00:33:09,255 --> 00:33:11,256
the powers that be decided that...

445
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,759
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

446
00:33:14,844 --> 00:33:17,596
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.

447
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:20,891
As you know,

448
00:33:20,975 --> 00:33:24,686
special detail carries with it special privileges.

449
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,855
It was outdoor detail...

450
00:33:28,357 --> 00:33:31,943
..and May is one damn fine month
to be working outdoors.

451
00:33:32,028 --> 00:33:33,653
Stay in line there.

452
00:33:33,738 --> 00:33:36,656
More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.

453
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:43,331
Wallace E Unger.

454
00:33:44,499 --> 00:33:46,959
Ellis Redding.

455
00:33:47,044 --> 00:33:49,879
Wouldn't you know it?

456
00:33:49,963 --> 00:33:52,548
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names.

457
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:54,717
Andrew Dufresne.

458
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:58,346
It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.

459
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:01,140
I made my usual 20 per cent, of course.

460
00:34:01,224 --> 00:34:04,810
So, this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

461
00:34:04,895 --> 00:34:06,604
I say, "Yeah?"

462
00:34:06,688 --> 00:34:10,399
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

463
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:12,985
Oh, damn, Byron. I'm sorry to hear that.

464
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,445
I'm not. He was an asshole.

465
00:34:14,529 --> 00:34:16,864
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead, anyway.

466
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:20,910
So, anyway, this lawyer fella says to me,
"Your brother died a rich man."

467
00:34:20,994 --> 00:34:23,704
Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.

468
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:26,248
A million bucks?

469
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,709
Fucking incredible
how lucky some assholes get.

470
00:34:28,794 --> 00:34:31,337
Jeez-Louise! Are you gonna see any of that?

471
00:34:31,421 --> 00:34:34,507
35,000. That's what he left me.

472
00:34:34,591 --> 00:34:36,509
- Dollars?
- Yeah.

473
00:34:36,593 --> 00:34:39,721
Holy shit! That's great.
That's like winning the sweepstakes.

474
00:34:39,806 --> 00:34:41,014
Isn't it?

475
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:44,142
Dumb shit. What do you think
the government's gonna do to me?

476
00:34:44,227 --> 00:34:46,770
Take a big, wet bite out of my ass, is what.

477
00:34:46,771 --> 00:34:50,941
Poor Byron! Terrible fucking luck, huh?

478
00:34:51,025 --> 00:34:53,694
Crying shame.

479
00:34:53,778 --> 00:34:55,445
Some people really got it awful!

480
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,072
Andy, are you nuts?

481
00:34:57,156 --> 00:34:59,282
Keep your eyes on your mop, man. Andy!

482
00:34:59,283 --> 00:35:02,327
Well, you'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up...

483
00:35:02,412 --> 00:35:05,247
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Maybe enough to buy a new car. Then what?

484
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:07,708
I've got to pay tax on the car.

485
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:11,670
Repair, maintenance, goddamn kids
pestering me to take them for a ride...

486
00:35:11,754 --> 00:35:15,674
And at the end of the year, you figure the tax
wrong, you pay them out of your own pocket.

487
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:17,926
I tell you...Uncle Sam!

488
00:35:18,011 --> 00:35:21,763
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

489
00:35:21,848 --> 00:35:24,558
- Andy! Andy!
- What's he doing?

490
00:35:24,642 --> 00:35:26,977
- Getting himself killed.
- Keep tarring.

491
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:30,147
Some brother! Shit.

492
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:31,273
Hey!

493
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,821
Mr. Hadley...

494
00:35:36,822 --> 00:35:38,281
do you trust your wife?

495
00:35:39,825 --> 00:35:41,576
Oh, that's funny.

496
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,537
You're gonna look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

497
00:35:44,621 --> 00:35:48,082
I mean, do you think
she'd go behind your back, try to hamstring you?

498
00:35:49,168 --> 00:35:51,044
That's it. Step aside, Mert.

499
00:35:51,128 --> 00:35:52,628
This fucker's having an accident.

500
00:35:52,713 --> 00:35:53,880
He's gonna push him off.

501
00:35:53,964 --> 00:35:58,092
Cos if you do trust her,
there's no reason you can't keep that 35,000.

502
00:35:58,177 --> 00:36:00,053
- What did you say?
- 35,000.

503
00:36:00,137 --> 00:36:01,846
- 35,000?
- All of it.

504
00:36:01,847 --> 00:36:04,182
- All of it?
- Every penny.

505
00:36:04,266 --> 00:36:06,100
You'd better start making sense.

506
00:36:06,185 --> 00:36:08,519
If you want to keep the money,
give it to your wife.

507
00:36:08,604 --> 00:36:12,732
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

508
00:36:12,816 --> 00:36:14,358
Bullshit! Tax-free?

509
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:17,528
Tax-free. The IRS can't touch one cent.

510
00:36:17,613 --> 00:36:20,198
You're the smart banker what killed his wife.

511
00:36:20,282 --> 00:36:23,826
Why should I believe a smart banker like you?
So I can end up in here with you?

512
00:36:23,911 --> 00:36:25,411
It's legal. Ask the IRS.

513
00:36:25,496 --> 00:36:28,706
They'll say the same thing.
But I feel stupid telling you this.

514
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:31,084
I'm sure you would have investigated the matter.

515
00:36:31,168 --> 00:36:35,255
Yeah, I don't need no banker to tell me
where the bears shit in the buckwheat.

516
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:38,383
Of course not, but you do need someone
to set up the tax-free gift.

517
00:36:38,468 --> 00:36:40,344
It'll cost you. A lawyer.

518
00:36:40,428 --> 00:36:42,763
A bunch of ball-washing bastards.

519
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:46,683
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

520
00:36:46,684 --> 00:36:49,061
If you get the forms, I'll prepare them for you.

521
00:36:49,145 --> 00:36:51,021
Nearly free of charge.

522
00:36:52,107 --> 00:36:55,484
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my co-workers.

523
00:36:55,568 --> 00:36:57,986
Co-workers! Get him! That's rich, ain't it?

524
00:36:58,071 --> 00:37:01,532
I think a man working outdoors
feels more like a man

525
00:37:01,616 --> 00:37:03,367
if he can have a bottle of suds.

526
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:06,495
That's only my opinion...sir.

527
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:11,458
What are you jimmies staring at?

528
00:37:11,543 --> 00:37:12,543
Back to work!

529
00:37:12,627 --> 00:37:14,586
Let's go. Work.

530
00:37:22,971 --> 00:37:28,475
And that's how it came to pass...
that on the second-to-last day of the job,

531
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,231
the convict crew that tarred the plate-factory roof
in the spring of '49...

532
00:37:33,315 --> 00:37:36,526
wound up sitting in a row
at ten o'clock in the morning,

533
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:40,488
drinking icy-cold, Bohemia-style beer...

534
00:37:40,573 --> 00:37:45,785
courtesy of the hardest screw that ever
walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.

535
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,954
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

536
00:37:49,331 --> 00:37:53,501
The colossal prick
even managed to sound magnanimous.

537
00:37:55,254 --> 00:37:59,883
We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders,
and felt like free men.

538
00:37:59,967 --> 00:38:03,469
Hell, we could have been tarring the roof
of one of our own houses.

539
00:38:03,554 --> 00:38:06,848
We were the lords of all creation.

540
00:38:06,932 --> 00:38:11,477
As for Andy,
he spent that break hunkered in the shade...

541
00:38:11,562 --> 00:38:14,272
a strange little smile on his face,

542
00:38:14,356 --> 00:38:16,441
watching us drink his beer.

543
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,741
Hey...

544
00:38:24,825 --> 00:38:26,117
Want a cold one, Andy?

545
00:38:26,202 --> 00:38:27,869
No, thanks.

546
00:38:27,953 --> 00:38:29,746
I gave up drinking.

547
00:38:33,585 --> 00:38:36,754
You could argue
he'd done it to curry favor with the guards.

548
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:39,673
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.

549
00:38:41,927 --> 00:38:45,387
Me, I think he did it just to feel normal again.

550
00:38:46,473 --> 00:38:48,557
If only for a short while.

551
00:38:51,436 --> 00:38:53,771
King me.

552
00:38:53,855 --> 00:38:56,273
Chess. Now, there's a game of kings.

553
00:38:56,358 --> 00:38:58,901
- What?
- Civilized, strategic.

554
00:38:58,985 --> 00:39:01,320
And a total fucking mystery.

555
00:39:01,404 --> 00:39:02,613
I hate it.

556
00:39:02,697 --> 00:39:04,615
Maybe you'll let me teach you someday.

557
00:39:04,699 --> 00:39:07,159
Yeah. Sure.

558
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,370
I thought of getting a board together.

559
00:39:09,454 --> 00:39:12,248
Well, I'm the right man.
I'm the guy that can get things.

560
00:39:12,332 --> 00:39:13,832
We might do business on a board.

561
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:16,710
But I want to carve the pieces myself.

562
00:39:16,795 --> 00:39:20,381
One side in alabaster, the opposing side
in soapstone. What do you think?

563
00:39:20,465 --> 00:39:22,383
I think it'll take years.

564
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:25,052
Well, years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

565
00:39:25,136 --> 00:39:27,304
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

566
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:29,349
Pebbles, mostly.

567
00:39:33,688 --> 00:39:36,564
Andy, we're getting to be kinda friends,
aren't we?

568
00:39:36,649 --> 00:39:38,316
Yeah, I guess.

569
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,861
Can I ask you something?

570
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,947
Why did you do it?

571
00:39:45,157 --> 00:39:49,035
I'm innocent, Red. Just like everybody else here.

572
00:39:53,332 --> 00:39:55,417
What are you in for?

573
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,420
Murder.

574
00:39:58,504 --> 00:39:59,921
Same as you.

575
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:01,172
Innocent?

576
00:40:03,843 --> 00:40:05,927
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

577
00:41:05,405 --> 00:41:06,989
Where's the canary?

578
00:41:07,074 --> 00:41:08,407
How did you know?

579
00:41:08,408 --> 00:41:09,575
How did I know what?

580
00:41:09,659 --> 00:41:12,078
So, you don't know? Come.

581
00:41:14,831 --> 00:41:16,957
This is where the canary is, Johnny.

582
00:41:19,336 --> 00:41:23,339
Quite a surprise to hear a woman singing
in my house, eh, Johnny?

583
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,637
That's quite a...

584
00:41:28,721 --> 00:41:30,389
surprise.

585
00:41:32,892 --> 00:41:34,601
Red...

586
00:41:34,685 --> 00:41:36,478
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

587
00:41:36,562 --> 00:41:38,397
Here she comes.

588
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:41,358
This is the part I like -
when she does that shit with her hair.

589
00:41:41,442 --> 00:41:44,361
Yeah, I know. I've seen it three times this month.

590
00:41:44,445 --> 00:41:46,446
Gilda, are you decent?

591
00:41:46,531 --> 00:41:48,573
Me?

592
00:41:50,284 --> 00:41:52,327
Hah! God, I love it!

593
00:41:58,209 --> 00:42:02,003
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

594
00:42:02,088 --> 00:42:05,966
Yeah, I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

595
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,552
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

596
00:42:08,636 --> 00:42:10,470
Can you get her?

597
00:42:11,556 --> 00:42:15,016
So, this is Johnny Farrell.
I've heard a lot about you, Johnny.

598
00:42:15,101 --> 00:42:16,977
Take a few weeks.

599
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:18,270
Weeks?

600
00:42:18,271 --> 00:42:23,526
Well, yeah, Andy. I don't have her stuffed down
the front of my pants right now, I'm sorry to say.

601
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:26,112
But I'll get her. Relax.

602
00:42:28,365 --> 00:42:29,866
Thanks.

603
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,951
- It was a surprise, Mr. Farrell.
- It was.

604
00:42:32,035 --> 00:42:33,077
Sit down.

605
00:42:33,162 --> 00:42:35,079
Did you tell him what I'm doing here?

606
00:42:35,164 --> 00:42:37,999
No, I wanted to save that as a surprise, too.

607
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:39,750
Hang on to your hat, Mr. Farrell...

608
00:42:49,845 --> 00:42:52,096
- Take a walk.
- I gotta change the reel.

609
00:42:52,181 --> 00:42:54,265
I said fuck off!

610
00:42:59,104 --> 00:43:01,898
Ain't you gonna scream?

611
00:43:03,275 --> 00:43:05,067
Let's get this over with.

612
00:43:09,198 --> 00:43:10,823
He broke my fuckin' nose!

613
00:43:21,336 --> 00:43:25,380
Now...I'm gonna open my fly...

614
00:43:25,465 --> 00:43:28,425
and you're gonna swallow
what I give you to swallow.

615
00:43:29,511 --> 00:43:31,303
Then you're gonna swallow Rooster's.

616
00:43:31,387 --> 00:43:34,223
You broke his nose,
he ought to have something to show for it.

617
00:43:34,307 --> 00:43:36,517
Anything you put in my mouth,
you're gonna lose.

618
00:43:36,601 --> 00:43:39,353
No. You don't understand.

619
00:43:39,437 --> 00:43:42,731
You do that, and I'll put
all eight inches of this steel in your ear.

620
00:43:42,732 --> 00:43:43,815
All right.

621
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:48,529
But you should know that sudden, serious
brain injury causes the victim to bite down hard.

622
00:43:49,781 --> 00:43:52,199
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong,

623
00:43:52,283 --> 00:43:57,079
they have to pry the victim's jaws open...
with a crowbar.

624
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:01,542
Where did you get this shit?

625
00:44:01,626 --> 00:44:03,293
I read it.

626
00:44:04,379 --> 00:44:07,256
Know how to read, you ignorant fuck?

627
00:44:08,758 --> 00:44:10,634
Honey...

628
00:44:11,886 --> 00:44:14,263
..you shouldn't.

629
00:44:16,307 --> 00:44:19,310
Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth...

630
00:44:19,395 --> 00:44:21,771
and neither did his friends.

631
00:44:21,855 --> 00:44:25,149
What they did do...
is beat him within an inch of his life.

632
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,361
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

633
00:44:29,405 --> 00:44:31,906
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

634
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:37,996
Time's up, Bogs.

635
00:44:41,667 --> 00:44:43,751
It's your world, boss.

636
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:49,257
Return to your cell blocks for evening count.

637
00:44:49,341 --> 00:44:51,509
All prisoners report for lockdown.

638
00:45:07,067 --> 00:45:08,359
What?

639
00:45:20,832 --> 00:45:23,542
Where's he going?
Grab his ankles.

640
00:45:25,128 --> 00:45:27,630
No! No!

641
00:45:27,714 --> 00:45:29,089
No!

642
00:45:29,174 --> 00:45:30,507
Help me...

643
00:45:30,592 --> 00:45:31,884
Aaarghh!

644
00:45:34,179 --> 00:45:36,847
Two things never happened again after that.

645
00:45:36,931 --> 00:45:39,767
The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again...

646
00:45:40,977 --> 00:45:43,687
..and Bogs never walked again.

647
00:45:44,814 --> 00:45:48,233
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

648
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:54,031
To my knowledge, he lived out the rest
of his days drinking his food through a straw.

649
00:45:54,115 --> 00:45:58,786
I'm thinking Andy could use a nice welcome
back when he gets out of the infirmary.

650
00:45:59,913 --> 00:46:03,707
Sounds good to us.
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

651
00:46:05,085 --> 00:46:07,753
The man likes to play chess.

652
00:46:07,837 --> 00:46:09,922
Let's get him some rocks.

653
00:46:42,331 --> 00:46:44,207
Guys...

654
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:46,668
I got one. I got one. Look.

655
00:46:49,088 --> 00:46:51,172
Heywood, that isn't soapstone.

656
00:46:51,257 --> 00:46:53,466
And it ain't alabaster, either.

657
00:46:53,551 --> 00:46:55,176
What are you, a fucking geologist?

658
00:46:55,261 --> 00:46:57,303
He's right. It ain't.

659
00:46:57,388 --> 00:46:58,638
Well, what the hell is it?

660
00:46:58,723 --> 00:47:01,266
A horse apple.

661
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:04,477
- Bullshit.
- No, horse shit. Petrified.

662
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,738
Oh, Jesus Christ!

663
00:47:13,822 --> 00:47:15,781
Oh, damn!

664
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:19,827
Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

665
00:47:21,037 --> 00:47:23,664
And by the weekend he was due back,
we had enough rocks

666
00:47:23,749 --> 00:47:26,792
to keep him busy till rapture.

667
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:29,587
I also got a big shipment in that week.

668
00:47:29,671 --> 00:47:32,214
Cigarettes. Chewing gum.

669
00:47:32,299 --> 00:47:33,799
Sipping whisky.

670
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:37,428
Playing cards with naked ladies on them.
You name it.

671
00:47:37,512 --> 00:47:40,473
And of course, the most important item.

672
00:47:42,225 --> 00:47:44,310
Rita Hayworth herself.

673
00:48:18,471 --> 00:48:21,306
OK, look alive! Open all tiers.

674
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:23,725
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

675
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:26,061
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

676
00:48:28,189 --> 00:48:30,065
119.

677
00:48:31,567 --> 00:48:33,235
123.

678
00:48:42,703 --> 00:48:44,579
On your feet.

679
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,166
Face the wall.

680
00:49:22,661 --> 00:49:24,745
Turn around and face the Warden.

681
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,545
Pleased to see you reading this.

682
00:49:33,922 --> 00:49:36,215
Any favorite passages?

683
00:49:37,259 --> 00:49:42,388
"Watch ye, therefore, for ye know not
when the master of the house cometh."

684
00:49:43,432 --> 00:49:46,309
Mark 13:35.

685
00:49:46,393 --> 00:49:49,061
I always liked that one.

686
00:49:49,146 --> 00:49:50,646
But I prefer...

687
00:49:50,731 --> 00:49:53,482
"I'm the light of the world.

688
00:49:53,567 --> 00:49:57,111
He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,
but shall have the light of life."

689
00:49:57,195 --> 00:49:59,780
John, Chapter 8, Verse 12.

690
00:49:59,865 --> 00:50:03,326
I hear you're good with numbers. How nice.

691
00:50:04,453 --> 00:50:06,537
A man should have a skill.

692
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:10,083
Wanna explain this?

693
00:50:11,169 --> 00:50:14,630
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

694
00:50:15,673 --> 00:50:17,633
A little hobby of mine.

695
00:50:28,478 --> 00:50:31,480
It's pretty clean. Some contraband here,

696
00:50:31,564 --> 00:50:33,649
but nothing to get in a twist over.

697
00:50:37,487 --> 00:50:39,571
I can't say I approve of this.

698
00:50:41,074 --> 00:50:42,783
But I suppose...

699
00:50:44,744 --> 00:50:46,620
..exceptions can be made.

700
00:50:57,006 --> 00:50:59,299
Lock 'em up!

701
00:51:01,302 --> 00:51:03,261
I almost forgot.

702
00:51:03,346 --> 00:51:05,598
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

703
00:51:05,683 --> 00:51:07,141
Salvation lies within.

704
00:51:08,227 --> 00:51:09,560
Yes, sir.

705
00:51:17,861 --> 00:51:20,446
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

706
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:24,575
The truth is, Norton wanted to size Andy up.

707
00:51:38,215 --> 00:51:41,342
My wife made that in church group.

708
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:45,013
Very nice, sir.

709
00:51:46,181 --> 00:51:48,057
Do you enjoy working in the laundry?

710
00:51:49,685 --> 00:51:51,394
No, sir, not especially.

711
00:51:51,478 --> 00:51:54,272
Perhaps we can find something more...

712
00:51:54,356 --> 00:51:56,441
befitting a man of your education.

713
00:52:04,784 --> 00:52:06,452
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

714
00:52:06,536 --> 00:52:07,828
Andy.

715
00:52:07,912 --> 00:52:10,205
I thought I heard you out here!

716
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:13,292
I've been reassigned to you.

717
00:52:13,376 --> 00:52:16,545
I know. They told me.

718
00:52:16,629 --> 00:52:18,714
Ain't that a kick in the head?

719
00:52:18,798 --> 00:52:21,300
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

720
00:52:21,384 --> 00:52:23,469
Come on.

721
00:52:23,553 --> 00:52:25,721
Well, here she is.

722
00:52:25,805 --> 00:52:28,348
Shawshank Prison library.

723
00:52:28,433 --> 00:52:31,310
National Geographics.

724
00:52:31,394 --> 00:52:34,229
Reader's Digest condensed books.

725
00:52:34,314 --> 00:52:36,607
Louis L'Amour.

726
00:52:36,608 --> 00:52:38,734
Look Magazine.

727
00:52:38,818 --> 00:52:41,320
Erle Stanley Gardners.

728
00:52:41,404 --> 00:52:44,948
Every evening,
I load up the cart and make my round.

729
00:52:44,949 --> 00:52:48,118
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

730
00:52:48,203 --> 00:52:51,663
Easy-peasy, Japanesey. Any questions?

731
00:52:51,748 --> 00:52:54,708
Brooks, how long have you been librarian?

732
00:52:54,793 --> 00:52:59,963
Oh...I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

733
00:53:00,048 --> 00:53:03,426
And in all that time,
have you ever had an assistant?

734
00:53:03,511 --> 00:53:06,096
No. No, not much to it, really.

735
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,098
Well, why me? Why now?

736
00:53:08,182 --> 00:53:09,682
I don't know,

737
00:53:09,767 --> 00:53:13,103
but it'll be nice to have some company
down here for a change.

738
00:53:13,104 --> 00:53:15,188
Dufresne!

739
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:26,574
That's him. That's the one.

740
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:35,416
I'm Dekins.

741
00:53:35,501 --> 00:53:37,961
I was er...

742
00:53:38,045 --> 00:53:42,048
thinking about maybe setting up
some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.

743
00:53:44,385 --> 00:53:45,844
Oh...

744
00:53:45,928 --> 00:53:47,595
I see.

745
00:53:49,056 --> 00:53:50,932
Well, erm...

746
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:53,852
..why don't we have a seat,

747
00:53:53,936 --> 00:53:56,020
and talk it over?

748
00:53:58,566 --> 00:54:01,485
Brooks,
do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?

749
00:54:12,956 --> 00:54:14,665
Thanks.

750
00:54:14,749 --> 00:54:16,417
So...

751
00:54:17,669 --> 00:54:20,171
Mr. Dekins...

752
00:54:20,255 --> 00:54:24,717
And then Andy says to Mr. Dekins,
"Do you want your sons to go to Harvard,

753
00:54:24,801 --> 00:54:26,927
- or Yale?"
- He didn't say that?

754
00:54:27,012 --> 00:54:29,680
As God is my witness, he did!

755
00:54:29,764 --> 00:54:33,142
Dekins just blinked for a second.
Then he laughed himself silly.

756
00:54:33,226 --> 00:54:35,102
And afterwards he shook Andy's hand.

757
00:54:35,187 --> 00:54:36,562
My ass!

758
00:54:36,646 --> 00:54:37,855
Shook his hand.

759
00:54:37,939 --> 00:54:40,900
Hell, I...I near soiled myself!

760
00:54:40,984 --> 00:54:45,196
All Andy needed was a suit and a tie
and a little jiggly hula girl on his desk,

761
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,614
and he would have been:

762
00:54:46,698 --> 00:54:48,240
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please"!

763
00:54:48,325 --> 00:54:50,075
Making a few friends, Andy?

764
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,078
I wouldn't say "friends".

765
00:54:53,163 --> 00:54:57,167
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

766
00:54:57,251 --> 00:54:59,586
It's a wonderful pet to have.

767
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,588
Got you out of the laundry, though.

768
00:55:01,672 --> 00:55:03,882
Well, it might do more than that.

769
00:55:03,966 --> 00:55:06,968
How about expanding the library?
Get some new books in there.

770
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:09,763
If you're gonna ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

771
00:55:09,847 --> 00:55:12,307
- Right.
- How do you expect to do that?

772
00:55:12,391 --> 00:55:17,646
I mean, get new books in here,
Mr. Dufresne, if you please?

773
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:19,481
Ask the Warden for funds.

774
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,194
Son, son. Six wardens
have been through here in my tenure,

775
00:55:24,278 --> 00:55:27,906
and I've learned one immutable, universal truth.

776
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:29,699
Not one of them born...

777
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:34,663
whose asshole wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you asked them for funds.

778
00:55:34,747 --> 00:55:37,040
The budget's stretched thin, as it is.

779
00:55:37,124 --> 00:55:38,375
I see.

780
00:55:38,459 --> 00:55:42,003
Perhaps I could write to the State Senate
and request funds from them.

781
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:46,466
As far as they're concerned, there's only three
ways to spend money when it comes to prisons:

782
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:48,635
more walls, more bars and more guards.

783
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:53,139
Still, I'd like to try, with your permission.
A letter a week. They can't ignore me forever.

784
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,766
Sure can.

785
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:57,728
But you write your letters, if it makes you happy.

786
00:55:57,813 --> 00:56:00,106
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

787
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:05,069
So, Andy started writing a letter a week,

788
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,238
just like he said.

789
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:15,413
And, just like Norton said, Andy got no answers.

790
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:28,759
The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

791
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:31,929
The year after that, he did them all...

792
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:34,098
including the Warden's.

793
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:39,228
The year after that, they rescheduled
the start of the intramural season

794
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:41,397
to coincide with tax season.

795
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:47,903
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

796
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:52,116
So, Moresby Prison issued you your gun,
but you had to pay for it?

797
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,952
Damn right. The holster, too.

798
00:56:54,037 --> 00:56:55,287
That's tax-deductible.

799
00:56:55,371 --> 00:56:56,538
You can write that off.

800
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:59,958
Yes, sir.
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

801
00:57:00,043 --> 00:57:03,086
In fact, it got so busy at tax time...

802
00:57:03,171 --> 00:57:05,213
he was allowed a staff.

803
00:57:05,298 --> 00:57:07,758
Hey, Red, can you hand me a stack of 1040s?

804
00:57:07,842 --> 00:57:10,510
It got me out of the wood shop
a month out of the year,

805
00:57:10,595 --> 00:57:13,263
and that was fine by me.

806
00:57:13,348 --> 00:57:16,725
And still...he kept sending those letters.

807
00:57:22,023 --> 00:57:23,857
Red, Andy.

808
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,150
It's Brooks.

809
00:57:25,234 --> 00:57:27,694
Watch the door.

810
00:57:27,779 --> 00:57:29,363
Please, Brooks.

811
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:31,448
- Just calm the fuck down.
- Stay back!

812
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:33,575
- Stay back!
- What the hell's going on?

813
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:36,745
You tell me. One second he's fine.
Then out comes the knife.

814
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:39,289
Brooks, we can talk about this. Right?

815
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:41,500
Nothing to talk about, goddamn it!

816
00:57:41,584 --> 00:57:43,293
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.

817
00:57:43,378 --> 00:57:45,253
Heywood? Wait, what's he done to you?

818
00:57:45,338 --> 00:57:47,464
It's what they done!

819
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:48,965
I...I got no choice...

820
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:51,719
You're not gonna hurt him.
Even Heywood knows that.

821
00:57:51,804 --> 00:57:54,430
- Right, Heywood?
- I...I know that, sure.

822
00:57:54,515 --> 00:57:57,934
You won't hurt him, because he's a friend,
and you're a reasonable man.

823
00:57:58,018 --> 00:57:59,310
That's right. Right, guys?

824
00:57:59,395 --> 00:58:02,772
- Yes.
- So, put the knife down. Brooks, look at me.

825
00:58:02,856 --> 00:58:04,690
Put the knife down.

826
00:58:05,776 --> 00:58:06,943
Brooks...

827
00:58:07,027 --> 00:58:09,278
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

828
00:58:09,363 --> 00:58:11,697
Brooks, look at his neck. It's bleeding.

829
00:58:13,033 --> 00:58:14,617
It's the only...

830
00:58:14,701 --> 00:58:16,994
It's the only way they'd let me stay.

831
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:19,664
Come on. This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

832
00:58:19,665 --> 00:58:21,749
Put it down.

833
00:58:29,133 --> 00:58:33,845
Come on. Take it easy.
You're going to be all right.

834
00:58:33,929 --> 00:58:35,304
Him?

835
00:58:35,389 --> 00:58:39,058
Hell, what about me?
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat.

836
00:58:39,143 --> 00:58:41,769
Shit, Heywood,
you've had worse from shaving.

837
00:58:41,854 --> 00:58:44,105
What the hell did you do to set him off, anyway?

838
00:58:44,189 --> 00:58:46,524
Nothing. I come in here to say fare-thee-well.

839
00:58:46,608 --> 00:58:49,736
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.

840
00:58:51,781 --> 00:58:54,908
I just don't understand what happened in there.
That's all.

841
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:57,578
The old man's as crazy
as a rat in a tin shithouse.

842
00:58:57,662 --> 00:58:59,872
Oh, Heywood, that's enough out of you.

843
00:58:59,956 --> 00:59:02,958
- I heard he had you shitting in your pants.
- Fuck you!

844
00:59:03,042 --> 00:59:04,418
Would you knock it off?

845
00:59:04,502 --> 00:59:06,837
Brooks ain't no bug.

846
00:59:06,921 --> 00:59:08,797
He's just...

847
00:59:10,675 --> 00:59:12,509
He's just institutionalized.

848
00:59:13,845 --> 00:59:15,512
Institutionalized, my ass.

849
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:19,892
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood.
50 years.

850
00:59:19,976 --> 00:59:21,685
This is all he knows.

851
00:59:21,769 --> 00:59:24,188
In here, he's an important man.

852
00:59:24,272 --> 00:59:25,731
He's an educated man.

853
00:59:25,815 --> 00:59:27,900
Outside, he's nothing.

854
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:32,696
Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.

855
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:35,991
Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.

856
00:59:36,075 --> 00:59:38,160
You know what I'm trying to say?

857
00:59:38,244 --> 00:59:40,996
Red, I do believe you're talking out of your ass.

858
00:59:42,248 --> 00:59:45,167
You believe whatever you want, Floyd.

859
00:59:45,168 --> 00:59:47,712
But I'm telling you, these walls are funny.

860
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:51,216
First you hate 'em...

861
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,844
..then you get used to 'em.

862
00:59:56,472 --> 00:59:59,098
Enough time passes...

863
00:59:59,183 --> 01:00:02,143
you get so you depend on 'em.

864
01:00:02,228 --> 01:00:04,562
That's institutionalized.

865
01:00:04,647 --> 01:00:06,022
Shit.

866
01:00:06,023 --> 01:00:07,649
You can never get like that.

867
01:00:07,733 --> 01:00:09,651
Oh, yeah?

868
01:00:09,735 --> 01:00:12,320
Say that when you've been here
as long as Brooks has.

869
01:00:12,404 --> 01:00:14,280
Goddamn right.

870
01:00:16,617 --> 01:00:19,160
They send you here for life.

871
01:00:19,245 --> 01:00:21,329
That's exactly what they take.

872
01:00:23,249 --> 01:00:25,333
The part that counts, anyway.

873
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:35,009
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

874
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:38,763
You go on, now.

875
01:00:39,848 --> 01:00:44,519
You're free.

876
01:01:00,412 --> 01:01:02,288
Bye.

877
01:01:03,373 --> 01:01:05,291
Good luck, Brooks.

878
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:44,581
Dear fellas...

879
01:01:44,665 --> 01:01:48,877
I can't believe
how fast things move on the outside.

880
01:01:50,296 --> 01:01:53,340
Watch it, old-timer! Are you trying to get killed?

881
01:01:53,424 --> 01:01:56,760
I saw an automobile once, when I was a kid,

882
01:01:56,844 --> 01:01:59,763
but now...they're everywhere.

883
01:02:03,976 --> 01:02:07,562
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

884
01:02:23,913 --> 01:02:30,210
The parole board got me into
this halfway house called The Brewer,

885
01:02:30,294 --> 01:02:34,089
and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway.

886
01:02:36,133 --> 01:02:41,471
It's hard work, and I try to keep up,
but my hands hurt most of the time.

887
01:02:41,556 --> 01:02:43,557
Make sure your man double-bags.

888
01:02:43,642 --> 01:02:45,893
Last time, the bottom near came out.

889
01:02:45,977 --> 01:02:49,271
Make sure you double-bag, like the lady says.
Understand?

890
01:02:49,356 --> 01:02:50,815
Yes, sir. I surely will.

891
01:02:50,899 --> 01:02:54,694
I don't think
the store manager likes me very much.

892
01:02:57,656 --> 01:03:02,451
Sometimes, after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

893
01:03:02,536 --> 01:03:07,873
I keep thinking Jake might just show up
and say hello.

894
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:09,750
But he never does.

895
01:03:10,836 --> 01:03:16,215
And I hope, wherever he is,
he's doing OK and making new friends.

896
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,638
I have trouble sleeping at night.

897
01:03:22,723 --> 01:03:25,516
I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.

898
01:03:26,601 --> 01:03:28,519
I wake up, scared.

899
01:03:28,603 --> 01:03:32,606
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

900
01:03:34,234 --> 01:03:35,693
Maybe I should get me a gun

901
01:03:35,777 --> 01:03:39,656
and rob the Foodway, so they'd send me home.

902
01:03:39,741 --> 01:03:42,075
I could shoot the manager, while I was at it.

903
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,119
Sort of like a bonus.

904
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:49,875
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense
any more.

905
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:52,002
I don't like it here.

906
01:03:52,086 --> 01:03:54,755
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.

907
01:03:54,839 --> 01:03:55,922
I've decided...

908
01:03:56,007 --> 01:03:57,883
not to stay.

909
01:04:09,228 --> 01:04:12,731
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.

910
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:14,900
Not for an old crook like me.

911
01:05:17,923 --> 01:05:21,968
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.
Not for an old crook like me.

912
01:05:23,136 --> 01:05:27,181
PS. Tell Heywood
I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.

913
01:05:27,182 --> 01:05:29,267
No hard feelings. Brooks."

914
01:05:39,988 --> 01:05:42,072
He should have died in here.

915
01:05:47,495 --> 01:05:51,957
What the fuck have you done?
It's a goddamn mess. I'll tell you that.

916
01:05:56,671 --> 01:05:58,088
What's all this?

917
01:05:58,172 --> 01:06:02,050
You tell me, fuck-stick.
They're all addressed to you.

918
01:06:02,135 --> 01:06:03,427
Take it.

919
01:06:12,395 --> 01:06:13,979
"Dear Mr. Dufresne...

920
01:06:15,064 --> 01:06:17,065
In response to your repeated enquiries,

921
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:21,862
the State has allocated the enclosed funds
for your library project."

922
01:06:21,946 --> 01:06:23,322
This is 200 dollars.

923
01:06:24,365 --> 01:06:28,285
"In addition, the Library District
has generously responded

924
01:06:28,369 --> 01:06:31,079
with a charitable donation
of used books and sundries.

925
01:06:31,164 --> 01:06:33,248
We trust this will fill your needs.

926
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:37,462
We now consider the matter closed.
Please stop sending us letters."

927
01:06:37,546 --> 01:06:40,381
I want all this cleared out
before the Warden gets back.

928
01:06:40,466 --> 01:06:42,133
Yes, sir.

929
01:06:45,888 --> 01:06:47,263
Good for you, Andy.

930
01:06:49,892 --> 01:06:51,351
Wow!

931
01:06:52,436 --> 01:06:54,520
It only took six years.

932
01:06:55,814 --> 01:06:58,691
From now on,
I'll write two letters a week, instead of one.

933
01:06:58,776 --> 01:07:02,320
Oh, I believe you're crazy enough.
You'd better get all this stuff out,

934
01:07:02,404 --> 01:07:03,571
like the Captain said.

935
01:07:03,656 --> 01:07:07,533
Now, I'm gonna go pinch a loaf.
When I come back, this is all gone, right?

936
01:07:13,707 --> 01:07:15,708
Wow.

937
01:07:45,782 --> 01:07:48,492
Duettino from The Marriage Of Figaro

938
01:07:49,953 --> 01:07:52,538
Sull'aria...

939
01:07:56,167 --> 01:07:57,167
Andy,

940
01:07:57,252 --> 01:07:58,585
do you hear that?

941
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:02,381
#..zeffiretto

942
01:08:14,602 --> 01:08:22,443
Questa ser spirera

943
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:57,145
Sotto i pini

944
01:08:57,229 --> 01:09:02,442
Del boschetto

945
01:09:03,944 --> 01:09:06,321
Sotto i pini...

946
01:09:06,405 --> 01:09:09,282
Dufresne?

947
01:09:09,366 --> 01:09:10,950
Dufresne?

948
01:09:11,035 --> 01:09:13,119
Andy, let me out.

949
01:09:15,831 --> 01:09:19,375
Andy?

950
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:24,631
I have no idea to this day
what those two Italian ladies were singing about.

951
01:09:24,715 --> 01:09:27,133
The truth is, I don't want to know.

952
01:09:27,218 --> 01:09:29,303
Some things are best left unsaid.

953
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:38,395
I like to think they were singing about something
so beautiful, it can't be expressed in words...

954
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,856
and makes your heart ache because of it.

955
01:09:43,068 --> 01:09:45,778
I tell you, those voices soared...

956
01:09:45,862 --> 01:09:50,407
higher and farther
than anybody in a grey place dares to dream.

957
01:09:50,492 --> 01:09:53,869
It was like some beautiful bird
flapped into our drab little cage

958
01:09:53,954 --> 01:09:57,081
and made those walls dissolve away.

959
01:09:57,165 --> 01:09:59,500
And for the briefest of moments...

960
01:09:59,584 --> 01:10:02,670
every last man at Shawshank felt free.

961
01:10:05,173 --> 01:10:07,675
It pissed the Warden off something awful.

962
01:10:09,094 --> 01:10:10,219
Open the door.

963
01:10:12,973 --> 01:10:14,890
Open it up!

964
01:10:16,101 --> 01:10:18,477
Dufresne, open this door!

965
01:10:20,105 --> 01:10:21,438
Turn that off!

966
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:30,991
I am warning you, Dufresne. Turn that off!

967
01:10:44,839 --> 01:10:46,715
Dufresne...

968
01:10:47,842 --> 01:10:49,926
You're mine now.

969
01:10:57,476 --> 01:11:00,228
Andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt.

970
01:11:00,313 --> 01:11:02,731
On your feet!

971
01:11:03,941 --> 01:11:06,026
- Hey, look who's here.
- Maestro!

972
01:11:07,528 --> 01:11:11,573
Y- Y-You couldn't play something good, huh?
Hank Williams or something?

973
01:11:11,657 --> 01:11:14,326
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

974
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:16,203
Was it worth it, two weeks in the hole?

975
01:11:16,287 --> 01:11:17,537
Easiest time I ever did.

976
01:11:17,622 --> 01:11:20,665
Bullshit!
There's no such thing as easy time in the hole.

977
01:11:20,666 --> 01:11:23,293
A week in the hole is like a year.

978
01:11:23,377 --> 01:11:26,088
I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

979
01:11:26,173 --> 01:11:29,508
So, they let you tote that record player
down there, huh?

980
01:11:31,637 --> 01:11:33,262
It was in here.

981
01:11:33,347 --> 01:11:35,014
And in here.

982
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:40,478
That's the beauty of music.
They can't get that from you.

983
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:46,901
Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

984
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:52,657
Well, I played a mean harmonica,
as a younger man.

985
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:54,533
Lost interest in it, though.

986
01:11:54,618 --> 01:11:56,452
Didn't make much sense in here.

987
01:11:56,536 --> 01:11:58,996
Here's where it makes the most sense.

988
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:01,666
You need it, so you don't forget.

989
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,084
Forget?

990
01:12:03,168 --> 01:12:05,127
Forget that...

991
01:12:05,212 --> 01:12:07,296
there are places...

992
01:12:08,632 --> 01:12:11,175
..in the world that aren't made out of stone...

993
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:13,302
that there's a...

994
01:12:13,387 --> 01:12:15,221
there's something...

995
01:12:15,305 --> 01:12:18,099
inside that they can't get to...

996
01:12:18,183 --> 01:12:20,476
that they can't touch.

997
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,437
It's yours.

998
01:12:23,856 --> 01:12:25,565
What are you talking about?

999
01:12:26,651 --> 01:12:28,235
Hope.

1000
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:30,195
Hope?

1001
01:12:32,031 --> 01:12:34,700
Let me tell you something, my friend.

1002
01:12:34,784 --> 01:12:36,743
Hope is a dangerous thing.

1003
01:12:38,329 --> 01:12:40,372
Hope can drive a man insane.

1004
01:12:41,416 --> 01:12:43,333
It's got no use on the inside.

1005
01:12:43,418 --> 01:12:46,086
You'd better get used to that idea.

1006
01:12:48,506 --> 01:12:50,132
Like Brooks did?

1007
01:13:15,366 --> 01:13:16,408
Sit down.

1008
01:13:21,623 --> 01:13:25,084
It says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

1009
01:13:25,169 --> 01:13:27,795
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1010
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,964
Oh, yes, sir.

1011
01:13:29,965 --> 01:13:32,050
Without a doubt.

1012
01:13:33,093 --> 01:13:35,428
And I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

1013
01:13:38,015 --> 01:13:40,058
No danger to society here.

1014
01:13:40,142 --> 01:13:42,226
God's honest truth.

1015
01:13:44,563 --> 01:13:46,647
Absolutely rehabilitated.

1016
01:13:56,575 --> 01:13:58,659
30 years.

1017
01:13:59,745 --> 01:14:01,788
Jesus, when they say it like that...

1018
01:14:01,872 --> 01:14:03,956
You wonder where it went.

1019
01:14:06,919 --> 01:14:09,003
I wonder where ten years went.

1020
01:14:14,051 --> 01:14:15,343
Here.

1021
01:14:15,427 --> 01:14:17,595
Little parole rejection present.

1022
01:14:19,432 --> 01:14:21,475
Go ahead and open it.

1023
01:14:21,559 --> 01:14:25,354
I had to go through one of your competitors.
I hope you don't mind.

1024
01:14:25,438 --> 01:14:27,523
I wanted it to be a surprise.

1025
01:14:37,659 --> 01:14:39,743
It's very pretty, Andy.

1026
01:14:40,829 --> 01:14:42,913
Thank you.

1027
01:14:44,666 --> 01:14:46,750
Are you going to play it?

1028
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,965
No.

1029
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:57,344
Not right now.

1030
01:15:04,602 --> 01:15:06,687
Tier 3 South. Clear.

1031
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:09,773
Tier 4 North. Clear.

1032
01:15:09,858 --> 01:15:11,942
Tier 1 South. Clear.

1033
01:15:14,779 --> 01:15:16,865
Fall in!

1034
01:15:51,442 --> 01:15:53,026
Lights out!

1035
01:16:27,938 --> 01:16:29,980
Andy was as good as his word.

1036
01:16:30,065 --> 01:16:32,566
He wrote two letters a week instead of one.

1037
01:16:35,195 --> 01:16:39,323
In 1959, the State Senate
finally clued into the fact

1038
01:16:39,407 --> 01:16:42,284
they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.

1039
01:16:42,369 --> 01:16:48,958
Appropriations Committee voted
an annual payment of $500 just to shut him up.

1040
01:16:49,042 --> 01:16:50,751
And you'd be amazed

1041
01:16:50,835 --> 01:16:52,503
how far Andy could stretch it.

1042
01:16:52,587 --> 01:16:55,464
He made deals with book clubs, charity groups.

1043
01:16:55,549 --> 01:16:57,925
He bought remaindered books by the pound.

1044
01:16:58,009 --> 01:17:00,219
Treasure Island.

1045
01:17:00,303 --> 01:17:02,471
Robert Louis...

1046
01:17:02,556 --> 01:17:03,764
..Stevenson.

1047
01:17:03,848 --> 01:17:05,307
Fiction, adventure.

1048
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:08,936
What's next?

1049
01:17:08,937 --> 01:17:11,647
I got here Auto Repair and...

1050
01:17:12,692 --> 01:17:14,025
..Soap Carving.

1051
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:17,487
Trade skills and hobbies. Goes under
Educational. The stack behind you.

1052
01:17:17,572 --> 01:17:19,614
The Count Of Monte Crisco.

1053
01:17:19,699 --> 01:17:22,033
That's Cristo, you dumb shit.

1054
01:17:22,118 --> 01:17:25,912
By Alexandree...Dumass.

1055
01:17:25,997 --> 01:17:30,917
Dumb-ass?

1056
01:17:33,421 --> 01:17:35,755
Dumas. You know what that's about?

1057
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,215
Uh-uh.

1058
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:40,010
You'll like it. It's about a prison break.

1059
01:17:40,094 --> 01:17:44,097
We ought to file that under Educational, too,
oughtn't we?

1060
01:17:44,181 --> 01:17:48,351
The rest of us did our best to pitch in
when and where we could.

1061
01:17:49,604 --> 01:17:51,438
By the year Kennedy was shot,

1062
01:17:51,522 --> 01:17:55,859
Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of rat turds and turpentine

1063
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:59,195
into the best prison library in New England,

1064
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:03,158
complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.

1065
01:18:03,242 --> 01:18:07,412
Lawd I don't know what I'll do-ooo

1066
01:18:07,496 --> 01:18:10,248
All I do is sit and sigh...

1067
01:18:10,333 --> 01:18:15,087
That was also the year Warden Norton
instituted his famous Inside Out program.

1068
01:18:15,172 --> 01:18:17,882
You may remember reading about it.

1069
01:18:17,966 --> 01:18:21,385
It made all the papers
and got his picture in Look Magazine.

1070
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:23,137
No free ride.

1071
01:18:23,221 --> 01:18:26,182
But rather a genuine, progressive advance

1072
01:18:26,266 --> 01:18:28,434
in corrections and rehabilitation.

1073
01:18:29,478 --> 01:18:31,812
Our inmates, properly supervised,

1074
01:18:31,897 --> 01:18:34,649
will be put to work outside these walls,

1075
01:18:34,733 --> 01:18:36,817
performing all manner of public service.

1076
01:18:36,902 --> 01:18:40,821
These men can learn
the value of an honest day's labor,

1077
01:18:40,906 --> 01:18:44,575
while providing a valuable service
to the community and...

1078
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:49,872
at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q Taxpayer.

1079
01:18:49,956 --> 01:18:52,625
Of course,
Norton failed to mention to the press

1080
01:18:52,709 --> 01:18:56,003
that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

1081
01:18:56,088 --> 01:18:59,256
There are a hundred different ways
to skim off the top.

1082
01:18:59,341 --> 01:19:01,967
Men, materials, you name it.

1083
01:19:03,011 --> 01:19:05,763
And, oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in.

1084
01:19:05,847 --> 01:19:07,973
If this keeps up, you'll put me out of business.

1085
01:19:08,058 --> 01:19:10,227
- Ned!
- This pool of slave labor you've got,

1086
01:19:10,311 --> 01:19:12,354
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1087
01:19:12,438 --> 01:19:16,400
Ned, we're providing
a valuable community service here.

1088
01:19:16,484 --> 01:19:18,735
Well, that's fine for the papers

1089
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:20,320
but I've got a family to feed.

1090
01:19:20,405 --> 01:19:22,114
Sam...

1091
01:19:22,198 --> 01:19:24,658
Sam, we go back a long way.

1092
01:19:24,742 --> 01:19:27,077
I need this new highway contract.

1093
01:19:27,161 --> 01:19:29,371
I don't get it, and I go under.

1094
01:19:29,455 --> 01:19:31,498
That's a fact.

1095
01:19:31,582 --> 01:19:33,667
You just have some of this fine pie

1096
01:19:33,751 --> 01:19:35,794
my missus made especially for you,

1097
01:19:35,878 --> 01:19:37,212
and you think about that.

1098
01:19:45,263 --> 01:19:48,181
Ned, I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1099
01:19:48,266 --> 01:19:51,476
It seems to me I already got
my boys committed elsewhere.

1100
01:19:53,354 --> 01:19:55,939
You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.

1101
01:19:57,567 --> 01:19:59,735
And behind every shady deal,

1102
01:19:59,819 --> 01:20:02,028
behind every dollar earned,

1103
01:20:02,113 --> 01:20:05,282
there was Andy, keeping the books.

1104
01:20:06,325 --> 01:20:09,746
Two deposits.
Maine National and New England First.

1105
01:20:09,830 --> 01:20:11,914
Night drops as always, sir.

1106
01:20:42,321 --> 01:20:44,071
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1107
01:20:44,156 --> 01:20:46,949
- Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.
- Yes, sir.

1108
01:20:47,034 --> 01:20:50,787
Tell them if they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear about it from me.

1109
01:20:50,871 --> 01:20:52,872
How do I look?

1110
01:20:52,956 --> 01:20:55,666
- Very nice, sir.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1111
01:20:55,751 --> 01:20:57,460
The Governor's going to be there.

1112
01:20:58,879 --> 01:21:00,922
Want the rest of this?

1113
01:21:01,006 --> 01:21:03,090
The woman can't bake worth shit.

1114
01:21:04,468 --> 01:21:06,261
Thank you, sir.

1115
01:21:08,431 --> 01:21:12,184
- He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, I hear.
- What you hear isn't half of it.

1116
01:21:12,268 --> 01:21:14,728
He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of.

1117
01:21:14,813 --> 01:21:16,855
Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1118
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:19,817
There's a river of dirty money
running through this place.

1119
01:21:19,901 --> 01:21:23,153
But the problem with having all that money
is you'll have to explain

1120
01:21:23,238 --> 01:21:25,823
- where it came from.
- That's where I come in.

1121
01:21:25,907 --> 01:21:28,408
I channel it, filter it, funnel it.

1122
01:21:28,493 --> 01:21:31,036
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.

1123
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,789
I send that money out into the real world.

1124
01:21:33,873 --> 01:21:37,501
- And when it comes back...
- Clean as a virgin's honey pot, huh?

1125
01:21:37,585 --> 01:21:38,794
Cleaner.

1126
01:21:38,878 --> 01:21:42,506
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1127
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:49,680
If they ever catch on, though, he's gonna
wind up in here wearing a number himself.

1128
01:21:49,764 --> 01:21:53,016
Now, Red, I thought you had
a little more faith in me than that.

1129
01:21:53,101 --> 01:21:56,395
I know you're good, Andy,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1130
01:21:56,479 --> 01:21:59,481
Now, anybody gets curious,
the FBI, the IRS, whatever,

1131
01:21:59,566 --> 01:22:02,401
it's gonna lead to somebody.

1132
01:22:02,485 --> 01:22:04,445
Sure it is. But not to me.

1133
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:06,531
And certainly not to the Warden.

1134
01:22:10,578 --> 01:22:11,870
All right. Who?

1135
01:22:11,954 --> 01:22:13,663
Randall Stevens.

1136
01:22:13,747 --> 01:22:14,914
Who?

1137
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,712
The silent silent partner. He's the guilty one,
Your Honor. The man with the bank accounts.

1138
01:22:20,796 --> 01:22:22,964
That's where the filtering process starts.

1139
01:22:23,048 --> 01:22:26,217
If they trace anything,
it's just going to lead to him.

1140
01:22:26,302 --> 01:22:27,886
But who is he?

1141
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:30,013
He's a phantom, an apparition.

1142
01:22:30,097 --> 01:22:32,056
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1143
01:22:32,141 --> 01:22:34,309
I conjured him...

1144
01:22:34,393 --> 01:22:36,436
out of thin air.

1145
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:39,355
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1146
01:22:42,484 --> 01:22:44,861
Andy, you can't just make a person up.

1147
01:22:44,945 --> 01:22:48,072
Sure you can, if you know how
the system works, where the cracks are.

1148
01:22:48,157 --> 01:22:51,659
It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.

1149
01:22:51,744 --> 01:22:54,370
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate,

1150
01:22:54,455 --> 01:22:56,789
a driver's license, social security number.

1151
01:22:56,874 --> 01:22:58,082
You're shitting me?

1152
01:22:58,167 --> 01:23:00,126
If they ever trace any of those accounts,

1153
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:03,088
they're going to wind up chasing
a figment of my imagination.

1154
01:23:03,173 --> 01:23:05,257
Well, I'll be damned.

1155
01:23:06,551 --> 01:23:08,594
Did I say you were good?

1156
01:23:08,678 --> 01:23:10,846
Shit, you're a Rembrandt!

1157
01:23:10,931 --> 01:23:12,973
You know, the funny thing is,

1158
01:23:13,058 --> 01:23:17,019
on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1159
01:23:18,063 --> 01:23:20,439
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1160
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:30,574
Ever bother you?

1161
01:23:31,618 --> 01:23:35,037
I don't run the scams, Red,
I just process the profits.

1162
01:23:35,121 --> 01:23:37,164
Fine line maybe but...

1163
01:23:37,248 --> 01:23:39,959
I also built that library

1164
01:23:40,043 --> 01:23:42,670
and used it to help a dozen guys
get a high school diploma.

1165
01:23:42,754 --> 01:23:44,630
Why do you think the Warden lets me do it?

1166
01:23:44,714 --> 01:23:47,466
To keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1167
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:49,677
Money instead of sheets.

1168
01:23:49,761 --> 01:23:52,471
Well, I work cheap. That's the trade-off.

1169
01:23:58,061 --> 01:24:00,271
Willy And The Hand Jive

1170
01:24:08,072 --> 01:24:09,864
I know a cat named...

1171
01:24:09,949 --> 01:24:12,617
Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965

1172
01:24:12,702 --> 01:24:14,744
on a two-year stretch for B&E.

1173
01:24:14,829 --> 01:24:16,955
That's breaking and entering to you.

1174
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:21,668
The cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

1175
01:24:21,752 --> 01:24:23,503
Young punk.

1176
01:24:23,587 --> 01:24:25,630
Mr. Rock'n'roll.

1177
01:24:25,715 --> 01:24:27,382
Cocky as hell.

1178
01:24:27,466 --> 01:24:30,051
Hey, come on, old boys! Moving like molasses!

1179
01:24:30,136 --> 01:24:32,095
Making me look bad.

1180
01:24:32,096 --> 01:24:34,055
We liked him immediately.

1181
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:36,182
So I'm backing out the door, right?

1182
01:24:36,267 --> 01:24:37,976
And I got the TV like this.

1183
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:41,896
It was a big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Suddenly, I hears this voice.

1184
01:24:41,981 --> 01:24:44,024
"Freeze, kid! Hands in the air."

1185
01:24:44,108 --> 01:24:45,775
Well, I just stand there,

1186
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:48,653
holding onto that TV. So, finally, the voice says,

1187
01:24:48,738 --> 01:24:50,697
"Do you hear what I said, boy?"

1188
01:24:50,781 --> 01:24:53,158
I say, "Yes, sir, I sure did.

1189
01:24:53,242 --> 01:24:56,870
But if I drop this fucking thing,
you got me on destruction of property, too."

1190
01:25:00,959 --> 01:25:03,669
Hey, you've done a stretch in Cashman, right?

1191
01:25:03,754 --> 01:25:07,590
Yeah. Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1192
01:25:07,674 --> 01:25:10,301
Weekend furloughs, work programs.

1193
01:25:10,385 --> 01:25:11,802
Not like here.

1194
01:25:11,887 --> 01:25:14,221
Sounds like you done time
all over New England.

1195
01:25:14,306 --> 01:25:19,393
Yeah, I've been in and out since I was 13. You
name the place, chances are I've been there.

1196
01:25:19,478 --> 01:25:23,481
Perhaps it's time you tried a new profession?

1197
01:25:23,565 --> 01:25:28,652
What I mean is, you don't seem to be a good
thief. Maybe you should try something else.

1198
01:25:28,737 --> 01:25:32,573
Yeah, well, what the hell
do you know about it, Capone?

1199
01:25:32,657 --> 01:25:34,408
What are you in for?

1200
01:25:34,493 --> 01:25:36,118
Me?

1201
01:25:37,621 --> 01:25:39,705
The lawyer fucked me.

1202
01:25:43,418 --> 01:25:46,837
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1203
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:58,475
As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

1204
01:25:59,519 --> 01:26:04,648
Maybe it was the thought of them on the streets
or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.

1205
01:26:04,732 --> 01:26:08,568
Whatever it was,
something lit a fire under that boy's ass.

1206
01:26:12,532 --> 01:26:15,784
I was thinking of maybe
trying for my high school equivalency.

1207
01:26:15,868 --> 01:26:18,453
I hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.

1208
01:26:19,664 --> 01:26:21,873
I don't waste time on losers, Tommy.

1209
01:26:23,459 --> 01:26:25,544
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1210
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:29,464
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1211
01:26:31,134 --> 01:26:33,176
You really mean that?

1212
01:26:33,261 --> 01:26:34,928
Yes, sir, I do.

1213
01:26:35,012 --> 01:26:37,139
Good. Because if we do this,

1214
01:26:37,223 --> 01:26:39,975
we do it all the way, 100%, nothing half-assed.

1215
01:26:41,102 --> 01:26:43,186
The thing is, see...

1216
01:26:44,355 --> 01:26:46,189
..I don't read so good.

1217
01:26:47,316 --> 01:26:48,525
Well.

1218
01:26:50,278 --> 01:26:52,320
You don't read...

1219
01:26:52,405 --> 01:26:54,490
so well.

1220
01:26:55,951 --> 01:26:57,618
We'll get to that.

1221
01:26:58,704 --> 01:27:00,454
- R.
- R...

1222
01:27:00,539 --> 01:27:01,914
- S.
- S...

1223
01:27:01,999 --> 01:27:04,167
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1224
01:27:04,251 --> 01:27:06,669
He started walking him through his ABCs.

1225
01:27:08,338 --> 01:27:10,923
Tommy took to it pretty well, too.

1226
01:27:11,008 --> 01:27:13,968
The boy found brains he never knew he had.

1227
01:27:16,305 --> 01:27:20,099
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1228
01:27:20,184 --> 01:27:22,143
He really liked the kid.

1229
01:27:22,227 --> 01:27:25,396
It gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1230
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:28,482
But that wasn't the only reason.

1231
01:27:28,567 --> 01:27:31,027
Prison time is slow time.

1232
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:34,322
So you do what you can to keep going.

1233
01:27:34,406 --> 01:27:36,657
Some fellas collect stamps.

1234
01:27:36,658 --> 01:27:39,285
Others build matchstick houses.

1235
01:27:40,329 --> 01:27:42,705
Andy built a library.

1236
01:27:43,749 --> 01:27:45,791
Now he needed a new project.

1237
01:27:45,876 --> 01:27:47,919
Tommy was it.

1238
01:27:48,003 --> 01:27:52,216
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1239
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:55,928
The same reason
he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1240
01:27:57,305 --> 01:27:58,805
In prison,

1241
01:27:58,890 --> 01:28:02,017
a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1242
01:28:03,478 --> 01:28:07,940
By 1966, right about the time
Tommy was getting ready to take his exams,

1243
01:28:07,941 --> 01:28:09,983
it was lovely Raquel.

1244
01:28:27,252 --> 01:28:28,293
Time.

1245
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:35,592
Well?

1246
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:38,220
Well, it's for shit.

1247
01:28:38,304 --> 01:28:40,806
I wasted a whole fucking year of my time

1248
01:28:40,890 --> 01:28:44,059
- with this bullshit.
- It's probably not as bad as you think.

1249
01:28:44,143 --> 01:28:47,854
It's worse. I didn't get one thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1250
01:28:47,939 --> 01:28:50,441
Let's see how the score comes out.

1251
01:28:50,526 --> 01:28:53,152
Well, I'll tell you how the goddamn score
comes out.

1252
01:28:54,947 --> 01:28:56,864
Two points right there.

1253
01:28:56,949 --> 01:28:58,741
There's your goddamn score!

1254
01:28:58,826 --> 01:29:02,662
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5x5 is 25.

1255
01:29:03,747 --> 01:29:05,290
Fuck this place!

1256
01:29:05,291 --> 01:29:06,582
Fuck it!

1257
01:29:25,394 --> 01:29:28,146
I feel bad. I let him down.

1258
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:30,315
Ah, that's crap, kid.

1259
01:29:30,316 --> 01:29:31,858
He's proud of you.

1260
01:29:31,942 --> 01:29:35,069
We've been friends a long time
so I know him as good as anybody.

1261
01:29:35,154 --> 01:29:38,031
- A smart fellow, ain't he?
- As smart as they come.

1262
01:29:38,115 --> 01:29:40,158
He used to be a banker on the outside.

1263
01:29:40,242 --> 01:29:42,285
What's he in here for, anyway?

1264
01:29:42,369 --> 01:29:43,870
Murder.

1265
01:29:44,997 --> 01:29:46,748
The hell you say!

1266
01:29:48,877 --> 01:29:51,170
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

1267
01:29:52,213 --> 01:29:54,673
He caught his wife in bed with some golf pro.

1268
01:29:54,758 --> 01:29:56,842
He greased them both.

1269
01:30:04,726 --> 01:30:06,602
What?

1270
01:30:06,686 --> 01:30:09,063
About four years ago,

1271
01:30:09,147 --> 01:30:12,232
I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

1272
01:30:13,485 --> 01:30:16,570
I stole a car. It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1273
01:30:17,864 --> 01:30:19,907
About six months left to go,

1274
01:30:19,991 --> 01:30:22,034
I get a new cellmate in.

1275
01:30:22,118 --> 01:30:23,994
Elmo Blatch.

1276
01:30:25,038 --> 01:30:26,622
Big, twitchy fucker.

1277
01:30:26,623 --> 01:30:28,916
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.

1278
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,043
You know what I'm saying?

1279
01:30:31,127 --> 01:30:33,170
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1280
01:30:33,254 --> 01:30:36,465
He said he'd pulled hundreds of jobs.

1281
01:30:36,549 --> 01:30:38,425
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.

1282
01:30:38,510 --> 01:30:41,512
You'd cut a loud fart,
he'd jump three feet in the air.

1283
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:44,681
Talked all the time, too.

1284
01:30:44,766 --> 01:30:47,102
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1285
01:30:47,186 --> 01:30:49,229
Places he'd been in,

1286
01:30:49,313 --> 01:30:51,981
jobs he'd pulled, women he'd fucked.

1287
01:30:52,066 --> 01:30:54,484
Even people he'd killed.

1288
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,696
People who gave him shit.

1289
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:01,783
That's how he put it.

1290
01:31:01,867 --> 01:31:03,410
So...

1291
01:31:03,494 --> 01:31:05,578
one night, like a joke,

1292
01:31:06,622 --> 01:31:09,916
I say to him, I say,
"Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"

1293
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,793
So he says...

1294
01:31:11,877 --> 01:31:15,505
I got me this job one time
bussing tables at a country club.

1295
01:31:16,632 --> 01:31:20,218
So I could case
all these big rich pricks that come in.

1296
01:31:22,638 --> 01:31:24,639
So I pick out this guy,

1297
01:31:25,683 --> 01:31:28,268
go in one night and do his place.

1298
01:31:30,438 --> 01:31:32,439
He wakes up.

1299
01:31:32,523 --> 01:31:34,566
He gives me shit.

1300
01:31:35,609 --> 01:31:37,694
So I killed him.

1301
01:31:38,737 --> 01:31:40,822
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1302
01:31:43,117 --> 01:31:45,035
That's the best part.

1303
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:49,290
She's fucking this prick, see, this golf pro.

1304
01:31:49,374 --> 01:31:51,459
But she's married to some other guy.

1305
01:31:52,502 --> 01:31:54,587
Some hotshot banker.

1306
01:31:56,381 --> 01:31:58,466
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1307
01:32:09,603 --> 01:32:13,439
I have to say
that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

1308
01:32:15,066 --> 01:32:17,943
What amazes me most is
you were taken in by it.

1309
01:32:18,028 --> 01:32:19,653
Sir?

1310
01:32:19,738 --> 01:32:21,405
Well...

1311
01:32:21,490 --> 01:32:24,867
it's obvious this fella Williams
is impressed with you.

1312
01:32:24,951 --> 01:32:27,036
He hears your tale of woe

1313
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:30,039
and quite naturally wants to cheer you up.

1314
01:32:30,123 --> 01:32:32,166
He's young, not terribly bright.

1315
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:36,128
Not surprising he wouldn't know
what a state he'd put you in.

1316
01:32:36,213 --> 01:32:38,339
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1317
01:32:38,423 --> 01:32:42,469
Well, let's say, for the moment,
this Blatch does exist.

1318
01:32:42,553 --> 01:32:45,680
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry,

1319
01:32:45,765 --> 01:32:47,974
"Yes, I did it! I confess!

1320
01:32:48,059 --> 01:32:50,268
And by the way,
add a life term to my sentence"?

1321
01:32:50,353 --> 01:32:53,522
That doesn't matter.
With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.

1322
01:32:53,606 --> 01:32:56,816
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.

1323
01:32:56,901 --> 01:32:58,944
The chances are he'd be released by now.

1324
01:32:59,028 --> 01:33:01,613
They'd have his last address,
names of relatives.

1325
01:33:01,697 --> 01:33:03,865
There's a chance, isn't there?

1326
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:07,786
How can you be so obtuse?

1327
01:33:07,870 --> 01:33:09,371
What?

1328
01:33:10,873 --> 01:33:12,707
What did you call me?

1329
01:33:12,792 --> 01:33:14,626
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1330
01:33:14,710 --> 01:33:16,503
Son, you're forgetting yourself.

1331
01:33:16,587 --> 01:33:19,422
The country club will have his old timecards,

1332
01:33:19,507 --> 01:33:21,633
records, W-2s,

1333
01:33:21,717 --> 01:33:25,720
- with his name on them.
- If you indulge this fantasy, that's your business.

1334
01:33:25,805 --> 01:33:29,766
- Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.
- Sir, if I were to ever get out,

1335
01:33:29,850 --> 01:33:34,854
I would never mention what goes on in here.
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering money.

1336
01:33:36,649 --> 01:33:39,651
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1337
01:33:39,736 --> 01:33:41,612
Not in this office.

1338
01:33:41,613 --> 01:33:43,739
Not anywhere! Get in here now.

1339
01:33:43,824 --> 01:33:47,076
I'm just trying to set your mind at ease,
that's all. Sir, I...

1340
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:48,536
Solitary. A month.

1341
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:50,788
- Yes, sir.
- What's the matter with you?

1342
01:33:50,872 --> 01:33:54,125
- Get him out of here.
- This is my chance to get out! Don't you see?

1343
01:33:54,126 --> 01:33:56,127
It's my life! Don't you understand?

1344
01:33:56,211 --> 01:33:58,671
- Get him out! Get him out!
- This is my life!

1345
01:33:58,755 --> 01:34:00,006
No!

1346
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:01,924
A month in the hole.

1347
01:34:02,009 --> 01:34:04,594
It's the longest damn stretch I ever heard of.

1348
01:34:04,678 --> 01:34:06,470
It's all my fault.

1349
01:34:06,555 --> 01:34:07,972
Oh, bullshit.

1350
01:34:08,056 --> 01:34:11,350
You didn't pull the trigger
and you certainly didn't convict him.

1351
01:34:11,435 --> 01:34:13,811
Red, are you saying that Andy is innocent?

1352
01:34:13,895 --> 01:34:16,063
I mean, for real innocent?

1353
01:34:16,148 --> 01:34:18,190
It looks that way.

1354
01:34:18,275 --> 01:34:20,318
Sweet Jesus.

1355
01:34:20,402 --> 01:34:22,445
How long's he been here now?

1356
01:34:22,529 --> 01:34:24,572
1947. What is that?

1357
01:34:24,656 --> 01:34:26,198
- 19 years.
19 years...

1358
01:34:26,283 --> 01:34:28,909
Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

1359
01:34:31,288 --> 01:34:33,539
- Paxon, Edward.
- Yeah.

1360
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:37,668
What you got? Board of Education.

1361
01:34:37,753 --> 01:34:40,422
- The son of a bitch mailed it.
- Looks like he did.

1362
01:34:40,506 --> 01:34:43,550
Are you gonna open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1363
01:34:43,635 --> 01:34:45,719
The thumb up my butt sounds better.

1364
01:34:46,763 --> 01:34:49,514
Hey, Skeet, come on,
give me that, you shithead.

1365
01:34:50,558 --> 01:34:52,768
- Floyd, come on.
- Over here, over here!

1366
01:34:53,811 --> 01:34:55,896
Hey, Red!

1367
01:34:57,023 --> 01:34:59,441
Come on, will you throw that away, please?

1368
01:35:05,031 --> 01:35:07,115
Well, shit.

1369
01:35:19,337 --> 01:35:22,047
The kid passed. C+ average.

1370
01:35:22,131 --> 01:35:24,216
Thought you'd like to know.

1371
01:35:40,776 --> 01:35:42,860
The Warden wants to talk.

1372
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:57,375
Out here?

1373
01:35:57,459 --> 01:35:59,544
That's what the man said.

1374
01:36:15,853 --> 01:36:17,645
Warden?

1375
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:19,814
Tommy.

1376
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:26,738
Tommy...

1377
01:36:26,822 --> 01:36:30,908
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1378
01:36:32,327 --> 01:36:34,413
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1379
01:36:52,891 --> 01:36:54,975
We got a situation here.

1380
01:36:56,019 --> 01:36:58,061
I think you can appreciate that.

1381
01:36:58,146 --> 01:36:59,605
Yes, sir.

1382
01:36:59,689 --> 01:37:01,190
I sure can.

1383
01:37:01,274 --> 01:37:05,319
I tell you, son, this thing really came along
and knocked my wind out.

1384
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:09,573
It's got me up nights, that's the truth.

1385
01:37:11,785 --> 01:37:13,869
The right thing to do.

1386
01:37:15,205 --> 01:37:18,207
Sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

1387
01:37:19,918 --> 01:37:21,960
You understand?

1388
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,422
I need your help, son.

1389
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:28,926
If I'm going to move on this,

1390
01:37:28,927 --> 01:37:31,678
there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

1391
01:37:33,224 --> 01:37:36,643
I have to know
if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

1392
01:37:36,727 --> 01:37:38,311
Yes, sir.

1393
01:37:38,312 --> 01:37:39,938
Absolutely.

1394
01:37:40,022 --> 01:37:43,107
Would you be willing
to swear before a judge and jury,

1395
01:37:43,192 --> 01:37:45,610
having placed your hand on the Good Book

1396
01:37:45,611 --> 01:37:48,321
and taken an oath before Almighty God himself?

1397
01:37:48,405 --> 01:37:50,532
Just give me that chance.

1398
01:37:54,453 --> 01:37:56,120
That's what I thought.

1399
01:38:43,211 --> 01:38:45,296
I'm sure by now you've heard...

1400
01:38:46,548 --> 01:38:47,923
A terrible thing.

1401
01:38:49,384 --> 01:38:52,970
A man that young, less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1402
01:38:54,055 --> 01:38:56,682
It broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

1403
01:38:57,726 --> 01:38:59,810
Truly, it did.

1404
01:39:01,855 --> 01:39:03,939
We just have to put it behind us.

1405
01:39:06,109 --> 01:39:07,526
Move on.

1406
01:39:08,987 --> 01:39:10,863
I'm done.

1407
01:39:11,907 --> 01:39:13,991
Everything stops.

1408
01:39:15,035 --> 01:39:17,870
Get someone else to run your scams.

1409
01:39:19,205 --> 01:39:21,290
Nothing stops.

1410
01:39:22,334 --> 01:39:24,418
Nothing.

1411
01:39:26,171 --> 01:39:28,256
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1412
01:39:30,134 --> 01:39:32,719
No more protection from the guards.

1413
01:39:32,803 --> 01:39:35,138
I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton

1414
01:39:35,222 --> 01:39:37,390
and cast you down with the Sodomites.

1415
01:39:39,143 --> 01:39:41,645
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

1416
01:39:42,939 --> 01:39:44,981
And the library?

1417
01:39:45,066 --> 01:39:46,191
Gone.

1418
01:39:46,275 --> 01:39:48,652
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1419
01:39:49,695 --> 01:39:52,489
We'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.

1420
01:39:52,573 --> 01:39:54,616
They'll see the flames for miles.

1421
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:57,202
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1422
01:39:58,788 --> 01:40:00,705
You understand me?

1423
01:40:00,790 --> 01:40:02,874
Catching my drift?

1424
01:40:05,962 --> 01:40:08,046
Or am I being obtuse?

1425
01:40:19,183 --> 01:40:21,309
Give him another month to think about it.

1426
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:11,944
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

1427
01:41:12,029 --> 01:41:14,113
Like a closed book.

1428
01:41:15,323 --> 01:41:18,075
Complained about it all the time.

1429
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:20,244
She was beautiful.

1430
01:41:22,456 --> 01:41:24,541
God, I loved her.

1431
01:41:27,545 --> 01:41:29,880
I just didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1432
01:41:32,383 --> 01:41:34,468
I killed her, Red.

1433
01:41:35,928 --> 01:41:38,013
I didn't pull the trigger.

1434
01:41:39,432 --> 01:41:41,516
But I drove her away.

1435
01:41:42,727 --> 01:41:45,270
That's why she died, because of me.

1436
01:41:45,354 --> 01:41:47,439
The way I am.

1437
01:41:55,782 --> 01:41:57,866
That don't make you a murderer.

1438
01:42:01,079 --> 01:42:03,163
A bad husband, maybe.

1439
01:42:06,542 --> 01:42:09,920
Feel bad about it if you want to,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1440
01:42:10,004 --> 01:42:11,421
No, I didn't.

1441
01:42:11,506 --> 01:42:13,548
Somebody else did.

1442
01:42:14,842 --> 01:42:16,927
And I wound up in here.

1443
01:42:19,305 --> 01:42:21,389
Bad luck, I guess.

1444
01:42:24,311 --> 01:42:26,020
Yeah.

1445
01:42:26,105 --> 01:42:28,397
It floats around.

1446
01:42:28,482 --> 01:42:30,942
It's got to land on somebody.

1447
01:42:31,026 --> 01:42:33,277
It was my turn, that's all.

1448
01:42:34,363 --> 01:42:36,823
I was in the path of the tornado.

1449
01:42:43,413 --> 01:42:47,166
I just didn't expect
the storm would last as long as it has.

1450
01:42:51,255 --> 01:42:53,172
Do you think you'll ever get out of here?

1451
01:42:54,424 --> 01:42:56,092
Me?

1452
01:42:58,387 --> 01:42:59,846
Yeah.

1453
01:43:00,889 --> 01:43:02,849
One day, when I've got a long, white beard

1454
01:43:02,933 --> 01:43:06,435
and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs,
they'll let me out.

1455
01:43:08,355 --> 01:43:10,439
I tell you where I'd go.

1456
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:13,276
Zihuatanejo.

1457
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:15,278
Zi...what?

1458
01:43:15,362 --> 01:43:17,405
Zihuatanejo.

1459
01:43:17,489 --> 01:43:19,574
It's in Mexico.

1460
01:43:21,369 --> 01:43:23,579
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1461
01:43:24,831 --> 01:43:27,207
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1462
01:43:27,292 --> 01:43:28,750
No.

1463
01:43:28,835 --> 01:43:30,919
They say it has no memory.

1464
01:43:33,381 --> 01:43:35,924
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

1465
01:43:37,510 --> 01:43:39,595
A warm place with no memory.

1466
01:43:42,891 --> 01:43:45,184
Open up a little hotel,

1467
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:48,896
right on the beach.

1468
01:43:48,980 --> 01:43:51,023
Buy some worthless old boat,

1469
01:43:51,107 --> 01:43:53,192
fix it up new.

1470
01:43:56,154 --> 01:43:57,362
Take my guests out.

1471
01:43:57,447 --> 01:43:59,531
Charter fishing.

1472
01:44:03,453 --> 01:44:06,079
Zihuatanejo, huh?

1473
01:44:08,708 --> 01:44:12,586
In a place like that, I could use a man
who knows how to get things.

1474
01:44:19,011 --> 01:44:21,721
I don't think I could make it on the outside, Andy.

1475
01:44:28,479 --> 01:44:30,563
I've been in here most of my life.

1476
01:44:32,066 --> 01:44:33,858
I'm an institutional man now.

1477
01:44:33,943 --> 01:44:36,027
Just like Brooks was.

1478
01:44:37,446 --> 01:44:39,697
Well, you underestimate yourself.

1479
01:44:39,782 --> 01:44:41,866
I don't think so.

1480
01:44:44,495 --> 01:44:48,706
I mean...in here, I'm the guy
who can get things for you, sure.

1481
01:44:48,791 --> 01:44:52,710
But outside, all you need is the Yellow Pages.

1482
01:44:52,795 --> 01:44:55,213
Hell, I wouldn't even know where to begin.

1483
01:44:57,299 --> 01:44:59,634
The Pacific Ocean?

1484
01:44:59,718 --> 01:45:01,761
Shit.

1485
01:45:01,845 --> 01:45:05,014
- About scare me to death, something that big.
- Not me.

1486
01:45:05,099 --> 01:45:08,559
I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover.

1487
01:45:10,479 --> 01:45:14,107
Whatever mistakes I've made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1488
01:45:14,191 --> 01:45:16,359
That hotel, that boat.

1489
01:45:17,946 --> 01:45:20,114
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1490
01:45:24,744 --> 01:45:27,621
I don't think you ought to be
doing this to yourself, Andy.

1491
01:45:27,706 --> 01:45:29,748
These are just shitty pipe dreams.

1492
01:45:29,833 --> 01:45:32,793
I mean, Mexico is way the hell down there
and you're in here.

1493
01:45:32,877 --> 01:45:34,920
And that's the way it is.

1494
01:45:35,005 --> 01:45:37,631
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1495
01:45:39,384 --> 01:45:41,468
It's down there and I'm in here.

1496
01:45:44,180 --> 01:45:46,974
I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really.

1497
01:45:49,811 --> 01:45:51,854
Get busy living

1498
01:45:51,938 --> 01:45:54,857
or get busy dying.

1499
01:45:58,653 --> 01:46:00,738
Andy.

1500
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:05,284
Red.

1501
01:46:06,328 --> 01:46:08,746
If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.

1502
01:46:08,830 --> 01:46:10,664
Sure, Andy.

1503
01:46:10,749 --> 01:46:12,082
Anything.

1504
01:46:13,168 --> 01:46:16,629
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1505
01:46:18,632 --> 01:46:22,427
- Well, just... There's a lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

1506
01:46:22,511 --> 01:46:24,554
It's got a long rock wall

1507
01:46:24,638 --> 01:46:26,556
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1508
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:29,351
It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.

1509
01:46:30,728 --> 01:46:33,438
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1510
01:46:34,648 --> 01:46:38,443
We went there for a picnic
and made love under that oak.

1511
01:46:39,945 --> 01:46:42,030
I asked and she said yes.

1512
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:48,203
Promise me, Red,

1513
01:46:48,287 --> 01:46:50,288
if you ever get out,

1514
01:46:50,373 --> 01:46:52,415
find that spot.

1515
01:46:53,459 --> 01:46:58,922
At the base of that wall, you'll find a rock that has
no earthly business in a Maine hayfield.

1516
01:46:59,006 --> 01:47:01,508
A piece of black, volcanic glass.

1517
01:47:04,678 --> 01:47:07,472
There's something buried under it
I want you to have.

1518
01:47:07,556 --> 01:47:09,557
What, Andy?

1519
01:47:09,642 --> 01:47:11,726
What's buried under there?

1520
01:47:13,522 --> 01:47:16,899
You'll have to pry it up to see.

1521
01:47:22,239 --> 01:47:24,323
No, I'm telling you, the guy is...

1522
01:47:25,367 --> 01:47:27,451
He's talking funnier.

1523
01:47:27,536 --> 01:47:30,913
- I'm really worried about him.
- We ought to keep an eye on him.

1524
01:47:30,997 --> 01:47:35,042
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's got that cell all to himself.

1525
01:47:36,128 --> 01:47:37,586
Oh, Lord.

1526
01:47:37,671 --> 01:47:39,713
What?

1527
01:47:41,383 --> 01:47:43,717
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

1528
01:47:43,802 --> 01:47:47,304
- He asked me for a length of rope.
- Rope?

1529
01:47:47,389 --> 01:47:49,223
Six feet long.

1530
01:47:49,307 --> 01:47:50,766
And you gave it to him?

1531
01:47:50,851 --> 01:47:53,519
Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?

1532
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,229
Jesus, Heywood.

1533
01:47:55,313 --> 01:47:57,565
Hey, how the hell was I supposed to know?

1534
01:47:57,649 --> 01:47:59,567
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1535
01:47:59,651 --> 01:48:00,693
No.

1536
01:48:01,736 --> 01:48:03,946
Andy would never do that.

1537
01:48:03,947 --> 01:48:06,031
Never.

1538
01:48:07,075 --> 01:48:09,160
I don't know.

1539
01:48:11,205 --> 01:48:13,290
Every man has his breaking point.

1540
01:48:15,918 --> 01:48:17,169
Lickety-split.

1541
01:48:17,253 --> 01:48:20,130
- I want to get home.
- Just about finished, sir.

1542
01:48:36,230 --> 01:48:38,315
Three deposits tonight.

1543
01:48:46,699 --> 01:48:48,783
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1544
01:48:48,784 --> 01:48:52,245
And shine my shoes.
I want 'em looking like mirrors.

1545
01:48:52,330 --> 01:48:53,705
Yes, sir.

1546
01:48:59,003 --> 01:49:00,670
It's good having you back, Andy.

1547
01:49:00,755 --> 01:49:03,507
The place wasn't the same without you.

1548
01:49:50,556 --> 01:49:53,307
Lights out!

1549
01:50:24,048 --> 01:50:26,341
I've had some long nights in stir.

1550
01:50:27,385 --> 01:50:30,095
Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts,

1551
01:50:30,179 --> 01:50:32,014
time can draw out like a blade.

1552
01:50:38,396 --> 01:50:40,731
That was the longest night of my life.

1553
01:50:56,873 --> 01:50:58,498
Give me a count.

1554
01:51:02,837 --> 01:51:04,880
Tier 3 South. Clear.

1555
01:51:04,964 --> 01:51:06,299
Tier 4 North. Clear.

1556
01:51:06,383 --> 01:51:09,969
- Tier 3 North. Clear.
- Man missing on Tier 2.

1557
01:51:10,054 --> 01:51:13,139
- Cell 245.
- Dufresne.

1558
01:51:13,223 --> 01:51:16,142
Get your ass out here, boy.
You're holding up the show.

1559
01:51:18,646 --> 01:51:22,690
Don't make me come down there.
I'll thump your skull for you.

1560
01:51:30,282 --> 01:51:33,660
Damn it, Dufresne, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1561
01:51:33,744 --> 01:51:36,829
You'd better be sick or dead in there,
I shit you not!

1562
01:51:36,914 --> 01:51:38,748
You hear me?

1563
01:51:45,255 --> 01:51:47,340
Oh, my holy God.

1564
01:52:04,192 --> 01:52:06,902
I want every man on this cell block questioned.

1565
01:52:06,903 --> 01:52:09,113
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

1566
01:52:09,197 --> 01:52:10,406
Him!

1567
01:52:12,325 --> 01:52:14,410
Open 237.

1568
01:52:17,414 --> 01:52:19,540
What do you mean, he just wasn't here?

1569
01:52:19,624 --> 01:52:21,166
Don't say that to me, Haig.

1570
01:52:21,251 --> 01:52:23,502
Don't say that to me again.

1571
01:52:23,586 --> 01:52:24,670
But, sir, he wasn't.

1572
01:52:24,754 --> 01:52:26,922
I can see that, Haig!

1573
01:52:27,006 --> 01:52:28,799
You think I'm blind?

1574
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:31,927
Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig?

1575
01:52:32,011 --> 01:52:33,011
No, sir.

1576
01:52:33,096 --> 01:52:35,139
What about you?

1577
01:52:35,223 --> 01:52:37,057
Are you blind?

1578
01:52:37,142 --> 01:52:39,685
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1579
01:52:39,769 --> 01:52:43,063
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. See? Right there.

1580
01:52:43,148 --> 01:52:45,023
Dufresne.

1581
01:52:46,276 --> 01:52:47,943
He was in his cell at lights out.

1582
01:52:48,027 --> 01:52:51,238
It stands to reason
he'd still be here in the morning.

1583
01:52:52,323 --> 01:52:54,199
I want him found.

1584
01:52:54,284 --> 01:52:56,869
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast.

1585
01:52:56,953 --> 01:52:57,995
Now!

1586
01:52:57,996 --> 01:52:59,496
Yes, sir!

1587
01:53:00,623 --> 01:53:03,209
Let's go, let's go!
Move your butts! Move it!

1588
01:53:06,046 --> 01:53:07,088
Stand.

1589
01:53:08,215 --> 01:53:09,466
Well?

1590
01:53:12,845 --> 01:53:13,970
Well, what?

1591
01:53:14,054 --> 01:53:17,515
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1592
01:53:18,559 --> 01:53:20,185
He must have said something.

1593
01:53:20,269 --> 01:53:22,312
No, sir, Warden.

1594
01:53:22,396 --> 01:53:23,855
Not a word.

1595
01:53:25,858 --> 01:53:27,859
Lord, it's a miracle!

1596
01:53:28,903 --> 01:53:31,362
A man up and vanished like a fart in the wind.

1597
01:53:31,447 --> 01:53:33,198
Nothing left but...

1598
01:53:33,282 --> 01:53:36,201
some damn rocks on a windowsill.

1599
01:53:36,285 --> 01:53:38,036
And that cupcake on the wall.

1600
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:39,746
Let's ask her.

1601
01:53:39,830 --> 01:53:43,792
Maybe she knows. What say there,
Fuzzy Britches? Feel like talking?

1602
01:53:44,877 --> 01:53:45,960
Ah...

1603
01:53:45,961 --> 01:53:47,420
I guess not.

1604
01:53:47,505 --> 01:53:50,381
Why should she be any different?

1605
01:53:50,466 --> 01:53:52,926
This is a conspiracy.

1606
01:53:53,010 --> 01:53:55,220
That's what this is.

1607
01:53:55,304 --> 01:53:56,846
One big...

1608
01:53:56,931 --> 01:53:59,683
damn conspiracy!

1609
01:53:59,768 --> 01:54:02,436
And everyone's in on it!

1610
01:54:02,521 --> 01:54:03,813
Including her!

1611
01:54:38,473 --> 01:54:40,349
In 1966,

1612
01:54:40,433 --> 01:54:43,102
Andy Dufresne escaped

1613
01:54:43,186 --> 01:54:45,271
from Shawshank Prison.

1614
01:54:46,940 --> 01:54:49,692
All they found of him
was a muddy set of prison clothes,

1615
01:54:49,776 --> 01:54:51,819
a bar of soap

1616
01:54:51,903 --> 01:54:56,282
and an old rock hammer
damn near worn down to the nub.

1617
01:55:00,663 --> 01:55:05,500
I remember thinking it would take a man
600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.

1618
01:55:05,585 --> 01:55:08,295
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1619
01:55:26,856 --> 01:55:28,940
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1620
01:55:29,984 --> 01:55:33,486
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.

1621
01:55:33,571 --> 01:55:35,864
An Ice Age here,

1622
01:55:35,948 --> 01:55:38,533
a million years of mountain-building there.

1623
01:55:39,577 --> 01:55:41,995
Geology is the study of pressure and time.

1624
01:55:43,205 --> 01:55:45,248
That's all it takes, really.

1625
01:55:45,333 --> 01:55:47,375
Pressure...

1626
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:49,336
and time.

1627
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:52,756
That and a big goddamn poster.

1628
01:55:55,969 --> 01:55:57,345
Like I said,

1629
01:55:57,346 --> 01:56:01,140
in prison, a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1630
01:56:03,936 --> 01:56:09,106
It turns out Andy's favorite hobby
was toting his wall out into the exercise yard.

1631
01:56:09,191 --> 01:56:11,275
A handful at a time.

1632
01:56:13,111 --> 01:56:15,279
I guess after Tommy was killed,

1633
01:56:15,364 --> 01:56:18,199
Andy decided he'd been here
just about long enough.

1634
01:56:18,283 --> 01:56:20,493
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

1635
01:56:21,787 --> 01:56:23,871
I'm just about finished, sir.

1636
01:56:45,268 --> 01:56:47,353
Three deposits tonight.

1637
01:56:54,529 --> 01:56:56,571
Andy did like he was told.

1638
01:56:57,615 --> 01:57:01,118
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine.

1639
01:57:04,706 --> 01:57:06,748
The guard simply didn't notice.

1640
01:57:06,833 --> 01:57:08,875
Neither did I.

1641
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:13,296
I mean, seriously, how often
do you really look at a man's shoes?

1642
01:59:17,340 --> 01:59:23,512
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards
of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.

1643
01:59:24,848 --> 01:59:26,849
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1644
01:59:31,563 --> 01:59:33,772
500 yards.

1645
01:59:34,816 --> 01:59:37,317
That's the length of five football fields.

1646
01:59:38,361 --> 01:59:40,612
Just shy of half a mile.

1647
02:00:35,836 --> 02:00:40,381
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her little secret,

1648
02:00:40,466 --> 02:00:43,885
a man nobody ever laid eyes on before

1649
02:00:43,969 --> 02:00:46,388
strode into the Maine National Bank.

1650
02:00:46,473 --> 02:00:48,515
Until that moment,

1651
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:50,476
he didn't exist,

1652
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:51,894
except on paper.

1653
02:00:51,978 --> 02:00:53,020
May I help you?

1654
02:00:53,104 --> 02:00:55,147
He had all the proper ID,

1655
02:00:55,232 --> 02:00:58,859
driver's license, birth certificate,
social security card.

1656
02:00:58,944 --> 02:01:02,238
And the signature was a spot-on match.

1657
02:01:02,322 --> 02:01:05,366
I must say, I'm sorry to be losing your business.

1658
02:01:05,450 --> 02:01:07,451
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1659
02:01:07,535 --> 02:01:09,328
Thank you.

1660
02:01:09,412 --> 02:01:11,205
I'm sure I will.

1661
02:01:11,289 --> 02:01:13,415
Here's your cashier's check, sir.

1662
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:15,542
Will there be anything else?

1663
02:01:15,627 --> 02:01:16,627
Please...

1664
02:01:16,711 --> 02:01:19,797
Would you add this to your outgoing mail?

1665
02:01:19,881 --> 02:01:22,091
I'd be happy to.

1666
02:01:22,175 --> 02:01:24,510
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

1667
02:01:24,594 --> 02:01:29,390
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

1668
02:01:30,558 --> 02:01:37,022
All told, he blew town with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.

1669
02:01:37,107 --> 02:01:39,566
Severance pay for 19 years.

1670
02:01:47,702 --> 02:01:49,995
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1671
02:02:42,716 --> 02:02:45,718
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1672
02:02:45,802 --> 02:02:50,431
If you give up the right to remain silent, anything
you say will be held against you in court.

1673
02:02:50,515 --> 02:02:52,391
I wasn't there to see it.

1674
02:02:52,476 --> 02:02:57,355
But I hear Byron Hadley started sobbing
like a little girl when they took him away.

1675
02:03:02,778 --> 02:03:05,571
Norton had no intention of going that quietly.

1676
02:03:21,546 --> 02:03:23,005
Samuel Norton?

1677
02:03:23,090 --> 02:03:26,342
We have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.

1678
02:03:29,221 --> 02:03:30,346
Norton!

1679
02:03:30,430 --> 02:03:32,098
Open the door.

1680
02:03:32,182 --> 02:03:33,933
I'm not sure which key it is.

1681
02:03:36,812 --> 02:03:38,479
Norton!

1682
02:03:43,945 --> 02:03:46,029
Make it easy on yourself, Norton.

1683
02:03:57,333 --> 02:04:00,919
I like to think
the last thing that went through his head,

1684
02:04:01,003 --> 02:04:02,712
other than that bullet,

1685
02:04:02,797 --> 02:04:06,800
was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1686
02:04:08,469 --> 02:04:09,553
Carter, James...

1687
02:04:09,637 --> 02:04:13,014
Not long after the Warden
deprived us of his company,

1688
02:04:13,099 --> 02:04:15,350
I got a postcard in the mail.

1689
02:04:17,061 --> 02:04:19,479
It was blank but the postmark said...

1690
02:04:19,564 --> 02:04:22,315
Fort Hancock, Texas.

1691
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:24,443
Fort Hancock.

1692
02:04:24,527 --> 02:04:26,570
Right on the border.

1693
02:04:26,654 --> 02:04:28,697
That's where Andy crossed.

1694
02:04:28,781 --> 02:04:32,659
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down,

1695
02:04:33,703 --> 02:04:35,787
it always makes me laugh.

1696
02:04:37,206 --> 02:04:39,250
Andy Dufresne,

1697
02:04:39,334 --> 02:04:41,711
who crawled through a river of shit

1698
02:04:41,795 --> 02:04:43,880
and came out clean on the other side.

1699
02:04:45,090 --> 02:04:47,133
Andy Dufresne,

1700
02:04:47,217 --> 02:04:49,135
headed for the Pacific.

1701
02:04:51,722 --> 02:04:53,764
Hadley's got him by the toes, right?

1702
02:04:53,849 --> 02:04:58,060
And he says, "I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1703
02:04:58,145 --> 02:05:01,314
Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1704
02:05:01,398 --> 02:05:03,649
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1705
02:05:03,734 --> 02:05:06,235
"These friends of mine
could use a couple of beers!"

1706
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:08,404
- And he got it.
- And he got it!

1707
02:05:09,573 --> 02:05:11,949
Sometimes it makes me sad, though,

1708
02:05:12,034 --> 02:05:14,076
Andy being gone.

1709
02:05:14,161 --> 02:05:18,164
I have to remind myself
that some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1710
02:05:19,249 --> 02:05:21,334
Their feathers are just too bright.

1711
02:05:22,878 --> 02:05:24,921
And when they fly away,

1712
02:05:25,005 --> 02:05:28,925
the part of you that knows
it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1713
02:05:30,677 --> 02:05:32,136
But still...

1714
02:05:32,221 --> 02:05:36,391
the place you live in is that much more drab
and empty that they're gone.

1715
02:05:40,939 --> 02:05:43,190
I guess I just miss my friend.

1716
02:06:07,173 --> 02:06:09,049
Please sit down.

1717
02:06:14,639 --> 02:06:16,765
Ellis Boyd Redding.

1718
02:06:16,849 --> 02:06:20,227
Your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1719
02:06:20,311 --> 02:06:22,688
Do you feel you've been rehabilitated?

1720
02:06:24,816 --> 02:06:26,900
Rehabilitated?

1721
02:06:28,444 --> 02:06:30,529
Well, now, let me see.

1722
02:06:31,573 --> 02:06:33,907
You know, I don't have any idea
what that means.

1723
02:06:35,703 --> 02:06:38,246
Well, it means you're ready to rejoin society...

1724
02:06:38,330 --> 02:06:40,873
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1725
02:06:43,252 --> 02:06:45,336
To me, it's just a made-up word.

1726
02:06:46,380 --> 02:06:48,631
A politician's word so that...

1727
02:06:48,716 --> 02:06:54,220
young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie and have a job.

1728
02:06:56,640 --> 02:06:58,725
What do you really want to know?

1729
02:06:59,893 --> 02:07:01,811
Am I sorry for what I did?

1730
02:07:01,895 --> 02:07:03,605
Well, are you?

1731
02:07:05,232 --> 02:07:07,817
There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.

1732
02:07:09,403 --> 02:07:12,530
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1733
02:07:16,327 --> 02:07:18,411
I look back on the way I was then.

1734
02:07:20,998 --> 02:07:23,041
A young...

1735
02:07:23,125 --> 02:07:26,210
stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.

1736
02:07:30,049 --> 02:07:32,133
I wanna talk to him.

1737
02:07:33,511 --> 02:07:35,679
I wanna try and talk some sense to him,

1738
02:07:36,723 --> 02:07:38,807
tell him the way things are.

1739
02:07:40,977 --> 02:07:43,062
But I can't.

1740
02:07:44,272 --> 02:07:46,357
That kid's long gone.

1741
02:07:47,651 --> 02:07:49,735
This old man is all that's left.

1742
02:07:51,863 --> 02:07:53,364
I gotta live with that.

1743
02:07:54,699 --> 02:07:56,492
Rehabilitated?

1744
02:07:56,576 --> 02:07:58,577
It's just a bullshit word.

1745
02:07:58,662 --> 02:08:04,583
So you go on and stamp your form, sonny,
and stop wasting my time.

1746
02:08:05,669 --> 02:08:07,711
Because to tell you the truth,

1747
02:08:07,796 --> 02:08:10,297
I don't give a shit.

1748
02:09:36,511 --> 02:09:38,596
Here you go, miss.

1749
02:09:40,599 --> 02:09:42,057
Rest room break, boss?

1750
02:09:48,106 --> 02:09:52,401
You don't need to ask me every time you need
to go take a piss. Just go. Understand?

1751
02:09:53,612 --> 02:09:55,279
Yes, sir.

1752
02:10:05,332 --> 02:10:08,375
40 years
I've been asking permission to piss.

1753
02:10:09,377 --> 02:10:11,587
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1754
02:10:15,717 --> 02:10:17,802
There's a harsh truth to face.

1755
02:10:19,763 --> 02:10:22,097
No way I'm gonna make it on the outside.

1756
02:10:30,316 --> 02:10:33,777
All I do any more
is think of ways to break my parole...

1757
02:10:34,821 --> 02:10:36,905
..so maybe they'd send me back.

1758
02:10:42,411 --> 02:10:44,496
A terrible thing to live in fear.

1759
02:10:45,873 --> 02:10:49,251
Brooks Hatlen knew it, knew it all too well.

1760
02:10:51,420 --> 02:10:54,214
All I want is to be back
where things make sense,

1761
02:10:55,258 --> 02:10:57,759
where I won't have to be afraid all the time.

1762
02:11:00,638 --> 02:11:02,722
Only one thing stops me.

1763
02:11:03,766 --> 02:11:05,851
A promise I made to Andy.

1764
02:11:26,582 --> 02:11:28,666
Here it is.

1765
02:11:38,468 --> 02:11:40,553
Much obliged, sir.

1766
02:15:19,360 --> 02:15:20,652
Dear Red,

1767
02:15:20,736 --> 02:15:23,196
if you're reading this, you've gotten out.

1768
02:15:23,280 --> 02:15:27,534
And if you've come this far,
maybe you're willing to come a little further.

1769
02:15:27,618 --> 02:15:30,203
You remember the name of the town, don't you?

1770
02:15:32,498 --> 02:15:34,582
Zihuatanejo.

1771
02:15:35,626 --> 02:15:36,835
I could use a good man

1772
02:15:36,919 --> 02:15:38,962
to help me get my project on wheels.

1773
02:15:39,046 --> 02:15:41,172
I'll keep an eye out for you

1774
02:15:41,257 --> 02:15:43,299
and the chessboard ready.

1775
02:15:44,343 --> 02:15:45,718
Remember, Red,

1776
02:15:45,803 --> 02:15:47,846
hope is a good thing.

1777
02:15:47,930 --> 02:15:49,973
Maybe the best of things.

1778
02:15:50,057 --> 02:15:52,142
And no good thing ever dies.

1779
02:15:53,185 --> 02:15:55,645
I will be hoping that this letter finds you

1780
02:15:55,729 --> 02:15:57,772
and finds you well.

1781
02:15:57,857 --> 02:16:00,358
Your friend, Andy.

1782
02:16:34,936 --> 02:16:38,814
Get busy living or get busy dying.

1783
02:16:41,318 --> 02:16:43,402
That's goddamn right.

1784
02:16:48,909 --> 02:16:51,035
For the second time in my life,

1785
02:16:51,119 --> 02:16:53,204
I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1786
02:16:54,873 --> 02:16:56,957
Parole violation.

1787
02:16:56,958 --> 02:17:00,669
Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1788
02:17:01,922 --> 02:17:03,964
Not for an old crook like me.

1789
02:17:04,049 --> 02:17:06,133
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1790
02:17:09,846 --> 02:17:13,975
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still
or hold a thought in my head.

1791
02:17:15,019 --> 02:17:18,021
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1792
02:17:18,105 --> 02:17:20,815
A free man at the start of a long journey

1793
02:17:20,900 --> 02:17:23,818
whose conclusion is uncertain.

1794
02:17:26,697 --> 02:17:28,865
I hope I can make it across the border.

1795
02:17:30,743 --> 02:17:33,536
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.

1796
02:17:35,915 --> 02:17:39,125
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1797
02:17:41,879 --> 02:17:43,755
I hope.
